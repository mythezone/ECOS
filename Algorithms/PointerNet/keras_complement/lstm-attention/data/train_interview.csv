sp_19-03,Which people might believe Hong Kong is pretty crowded but Delhi is more crowded,1
sp_19-03,And it's very crowded even as compared to Hong Kong,1
sp_19-03,And the main thing about Delhi is that it's pretty hot,1
sp_19-02,But it was way different than the places I've been because I have only been to in Asia like it was a bit different to see what the culture was like there over there,1
sp_18-12,So I guess the pressure comes from that just wanting to be good at something,1
sp_18-12,And it still hurts when you lose,1
sp_18-12,But still I like competitions I mean I think you still want to win,1
sp_18-12,But then as soon as you realize that you can't beat them you try to win at something else,1
sp_18-12,And it it turned like you know at first it was academic pressure you want to compete with people with grades,1
sp_18-12,I guess most of the pressure came from myself of wanting to like compete with other people,1
sp_18-11,Actually I guess those are my main worries,1
sp_18-11,Whereas I feel like you know other students who are going to like PhDs they still get to learn stuff and get to be like top of their top of their field when they come out,1
sp_18-11,Like there is no room for expansion,1
sp_18-11,Other worries is just I'm worried about going into like a dead end career,1
sp_18-11,So I'll try to avoid that,1
sp_18-11,And I don't want to be like twentytwo years and still asking my parents for money,1
sp_18-11,So I'm worried that I won't be able to make ends meet,1
sp_18-11,But still like I have got to pay for my own rent got to pay for my own food,1
sp_18-11,I don't know if that's a good or a bad salary because in Hong Kong thirteen K is considered quite low,1
sp_18-11,I mean they are paying me thirteen K in Shanghai,1
sp_18-11,But I guess my main worry right now is just graduate pay,1
sp_18-11,Well love life I gave up on that long time ago,1
sp_18-09,So you know you learn not to care so yeah,1
sp_18-09,There are like hundreds of other like starving Somali children going through way worse,1
sp_18-09,Other than that yeah I mean I guess my attitude when going to an exam is like you know if you fail it what's the worst that can happen,1
sp_18-09,And I guess that's my way of coping with stress was to just not care,1
sp_18-09,So I tried like you know be better at something than wasn't just academics,1
sp_18-09,And then I ended up being a TA for that and I have been doing that for three years,1
sp_18-09,Well back when I was a first year this is this course called airship where they taught us how to build an app controller ship in the whole semester and that was a project,1
sp_18-09,So I started doing a bunch of other stuff so a few hackathons design competitions and also I did this like first year engineering course,1
sp_18-09,In terms of dealing with the stress I think at some point I realized that no matter how hard I studied I would never be as good in terms of like academics as the other people,1
sp_18-09,So I really like embedded systems so that's why I got that's why I ended up like working my job is like embedded systems related,1
sp_18-09,So they put me in ECE but I still tried to make the best out of that and I ended up liking certain parts of it,1
sp_18-09,But I try to make the best of it and in the beginning I wanted to do mechanical engineering but my GPA was too crap,1
sp_18-09,But the States was too expensive and this was my only offer in Hong Kong so I ended up coming here,1
sp_18-09,I think had I been given the choice I would have probaby went to the States and did something like psychology,1
sp_18-08,I got two and half weeks and I still haven't started looking at so kind of screwed,1
sp_18-08,Legendary but most of it is done and only a final exam is due,1
sp_18-08,And I didn't sleep for about like two days for that,1
sp_18-08,I mean the last major piece of work we had to hand in was the interactive systems presentation,1
sp_18-06,So that was a bit of stress but not the first time I not the first time I have been stressed here so it's all good,1
sp_18-06,And I think I did pretty poorly in the midterm as well,1
sp_18-06,So I found it really hard to like catch up,1
sp_18-06,And they were teaching about machine learning and all that and I have never learned any of that or had the right background for it either,1
sp_18-06,I think the course I found most difficult would probably be interactive systems because it was just a lot of information in a very short time,1
sp_18-06,And the courses I'm doing I did multimedia computing and also intro into interactive systems and also signal processing as well,1
sp_18-06,I'm a fourth year undergraduate student in the electronic engineering department,1
sp_18-06,So I'm currently what am I currently doing here,1
sp_18-03,I don't know like if I was to prefer another place I would probably prefer somewhere a bit slower like maybe Canada or something,1
sp_18-03,But it can get stressful as well and just being here for that many years I think I get the general impression that people here are kind of like rude,1
sp_18-03,Some things I like about Hong Kong is you're always busy,1
sp_18-02,But it's really a bit too slow for my liking the pace of life there,1
sp_18-01,I guess yeah nothing recently no good movies or TV shows,1
sp_18-01,TV series don't have time for them,1
sp_18-01,I haven't seen many yeah haven't seen many good movies because most modern movies are crap,1
sp_17-12,It's kind of a motivation that keeps you moving forward instead of being lazy and maybe stepping backwards,1
sp_17-12,So it's kind of balanced the pressure so,1
sp_17-12,But actually I think in my point of view every different every individual has its own strenghths and weaknesses,1
sp_17-12,And actually there is of course there is peer pressure because I the friends I used to I most the most of my friends are really excellent students in UST,1
sp_17-12,We can provide necessary support but when you like grow up like after eighteen when you are grown man you take responsibility for yourself and you bear the consequences of every choices you make,1
sp_17-11,So that's the most thing that makes me anxious,1
sp_17-11,So that's my major concern and I need to put effort in it,1
sp_17-11,Or maybe become a research assistant because I think it's better than being employed for now,1
sp_17-11,For the current one I think the most stressful thing is about whether I can work well with the professor and get the MPhil offer,1
sp_17-10,Yeah so actually I think that's basically the situation,1
sp_17-10,But I don't like it,1
sp_17-10,It's not saying that for local international do not have excellent students,1
sp_17-10,For the friends that I have in UST I actually for myself I don't distinguish people by where they come from,1
sp_17-09,The entry barrier is higher so mathematics yeah,1
sp_17-09,It's like if you take like biochemistry or biology or physics major it's kind of harder to change into other areas,1
sp_17-09,And because why I come to UST I still haven't decided which area it is that I'm interested in,1
sp_17-09,So it's kind of risky,1
sp_17-09,So it's more like it's like the risk is lower because if you spend time on your SAT and you didn't do it well and it will also affects your gao kao because you simply do not have enough time,1
sp_17-09,You don't need extra time,1
sp_17-09,So basically they don't want to they don't want me to receive that kind of education so,1
sp_17-09,And the the problem is that when I first come UST I didn't I fail to realize it in my first year of studies,1
sp_17-07,It's not very stable and not like the kind of job that you can do after you have attend a high level of degrees,1
sp_17-07,So actually another reason is that the previous the previous one is kind of joke actually,1
sp_17-07,And I I don't like to be the least of least educated person in my family,1
sp_17-07,It's like my parents and my grandparents are professors in universities so it's kind of strange that I only have an undergraduate degree,1
sp_17-07,And it's better and I think one reason I may think of that is basically because my background my family background,1
sp_17-07,But I it's not actually it's not very satisfying because I also wishes to continue my study,1
sp_16-12,And from the community here I have I don't feel any direct pressure but I just just feel like I just feel like they want me to interact more and yeah that's about it,1
sp_16-12,So my parents have always pressured me to do well and explore my surroundings,1
sp_16-12,My parents do my parents have always pressured me to do well in both academics and you know outside academics,1
sp_16-11,So yeah these are the two most pressing issues right now,1
sp_16-11,And I don't know whether this semester it's gonna go below I'm gonna fall below the border or I'm gonna stay or move up,1
sp_16-11,I've been on the borderline for for so for first class you need a three point five right and I'm right at three point five,1
sp_16-11,I've been able to get an internship at a small startup in Science Park but it's unpaid,1
sp_16-11,I haven't been able to get a job like a proper job,1
sp_16-11,I guess the most I mean there are a lot of issues that that are there but I guess the most pressing one now would be my plans for the summer,1
sp_16-10,I've been trying since last winter but you know it's pretty tough because you need to practice your pronounciation because that's where that's the part that's really tricky because of the nine accents that are there in the language,1
sp_16-09,The reason why I chose UST is because I knew that I wanted to do computer science wanted to get into computer science,1
sp_16-09,But yeah that's about it,1
sp_16-09,I could definitely do better there is a lot of room for improvement,1
sp_16-09,I would I could definitely do better in terms of both academics and my social life,1
sp_16-08,One is on the eighteenth and that's for databases,1
sp_16-08,But other than that I don't have any deadlines I just have exams coming up,1
sp_16-08,Thankfully I did the homework yesterday and all that is left to do is submit it,1
sp_16-08,I the most recent deadline I have is for for natural language processing for the natural language processing course which is tonight,1
sp_16-07,If I decide to really continue my studies,1
sp_16-07,And I also have plans I also have plans of doing MPhil not a PhD but just an MPhil,1
sp_16-07,And to sustain in a city like this one you have to be you have to be loaded basically,1
sp_16-07,And even if you do those are just for startups which don't pay that much,1
sp_16-07,Because you won't find the usual tech jobs in Hong Kong,1
sp_16-07,But I would like to work in a bank or in the fintech industry because that's I believe that's where you know that's where the money is at,1
sp_16-07,Everyone wants a job,1
sp_16-07,After after graduation I would like I would like a job like who wouldn't,1
sp_16-06,And and it really and it really hinders my ability to actually understand and retain what's taught in class,1
sp_16-06,And therefore as a result I'm I feel like I'm not really learning anything new which is frustrating,1
sp_16-06,And I believe that there are a lot of gaps in my knowledge that haven't been filled,1
sp_16-06,And the most difficult course for me would be this one because well the material is kind of tough,1
sp_16-06,I'm taking technical communication operating systems database management systems natural language processing and the beloved COMP4901i,1
sp_16-06,One of them is technical communication,1
sp_16-06,Okay so I'm taking I'm taking five courses this semester,1
sp_16-05,But I I I I don't hate the food here I like it,1
sp_16-05,Like ever since coming here I haven't really had food outside LG7 and LG1 and Einstein and the usual Ebeneezers,1
sp_16-05,I used to be but not anymore,1
sp_16-05,Okay well to be honest I cannot cook but and I don't consider myself a big food enthusiast,1
sp_16-03,And there's so much more order here than there is back home so yeah,1
sp_16-03,I obviously prefer I would obviously anyone would obviously prefer Hong Kong over that place because well it's far less chaotic,1
sp_16-03,And the reason why I don't like my current hometown is because of poor governance and the sheer chaos that plagues the entire city,1
sp_16-03,And well it's to be honest I don't really like anything about that place,1
sp_16-02,And it was it was pretty short it was like what a week,1
sp_16-02,And it was it was mostly it was a family trip so we didn't really go out much,1
sp_16-02,I haven't been on any trips recently but I can tell you my last trip was to was to Singapore,1
sp_15-12,I think I'm sane because of them,1
sp_15-12,My parents don't give me that much pressure,1
sp_15-12,So even when you are doing projects with people some people want to be better like or that competitive spirit that's there is because I'm not a very competitive person so for me it makes me a little tense when other people are like that,1
sp_15-12,So you feel the competition and I guess just the competitive pressure is what what makes life a little haywire in in this university,1
sp_15-11,That's that worries me because because there are generally too many things and if I do give the time to the competitions and the presentations and everything then I miss out on a lot of other things so yeah,1
sp_15-11,Job I am not so worried about because I have kind of like it is open ended but I still have some options so I am not worried about it,1
sp_15-11,So that is very turbulent,1
sp_15-11,But the friends that are not in UST they do not understand why I'm so busy all the time,1
sp_15-11,Because it is very difficult to like give time to your parents and your friends and everyone,1
sp_15-11,Thanks to UST like relationships is like really turbulent because of UST I think,1
sp_15-10,So there are a lot of things that I don't personally enjoy,1
sp_15-10,And that is one of the reasons like I don't know whether I want to stay in Hong Kong for that long because language is a big deal,1
sp_15-10,I have tried in the past to be integrated with the locals but it is harder because of the language barrier and everything,1
sp_15-10,It's not a very big community but but it is there and it helps,1
sp_15-09,But initially I didn't adapt so well but then over time it was okay,1
sp_15-08,I don't know how to do that,1
sp_15-08,And then I have the presentation tomorrow so I have to kind of prepare for the presentation during that time sadly,1
sp_15-08,Apart from that today is extremely stressful for me because like I have to go for an orientation then I have to go for a class which is like a class slash dinner,1
sp_15-08,And the lie detection presentation is tomorrow so we are finalizing that as well,1
sp_15-08,And as we haven't been able to put that much work in it it's more stressful,1
sp_15-08,So yeah a little stressed about that because we really wanted to win it,1
sp_15-08,But sadly we did not get much time to do that,1
sp_15-08,And we were planning on doing a lot of great things for President's Cup like expanding our database and like make it much better,1
sp_15-08,We qualified for President's Cup for our FYP so we have to thank you so we have to do the presentation tomorrow,1
sp_15-07,But I am not so sure about that right now because I don't because I feel that the technology they use I might not be so interested in it,1
sp_15-06,So yeah that is one of the harder courses for me this semester,1
sp_15-06,So a lot of internal working of the material is left to us which is so we have to work really hard for that,1
sp_15-02,There is nobody seems to be at work ever,1
sp_14-12,And but yeah I don't think that is doing a very good thing to my GPA so I might do an extra semester,1
sp_14-11,And yeah I could also use a better GPA but I don't see that happening anytime soon,1
sp_14-10,They don't speak Chinese,1
sp_14-10,I don't speak Chinese so I hang around with the people like me,1
sp_14-10,No because I hang around with more internationals because I am not really a good local,1
sp_14-09,Major computer science I don't know I just wanted to do that when I was in high school,1
sp_14-08,And then I have five finals fun,1
sp_14-08,I have this project well an AI project that I haven't started yet and it's due in four days,1
sp_14-08,Let's see what else yeah I have another project,1
sp_14-08,Yeah I just had one deadline fortysix minutes ago,1
sp_14-07,And I don't know I guess I'll just keep applying to jobs over there,1
sp_14-07,But my plan is to go back to the States and work because honestly the pay in Hong Kong is just too low for software engineers I think yeah,1
sp_14-07,Okay so it really depends on when I graduate,1
sp_14-06,The other courses are okay though,1
sp_14-06,And I would have to say software engineering is probably the hardest course I've taken because it's more than all of my other courses combined so yeah not really that fun,1
sp_14-06,Okay so I'm doing four no five COMP courses and one math course,1
sp_14-05,I don't know,1
sp_14-04,I used to do more sports but then I got lazy so,1
sp_14-04,Well all my leisure time so far this semester has been going to TV shows so yeah,1
sp_14-04,I haven't had that much leisure time,1
sp_14-04,And I'm not really sure actually,1
sp_14-03,And it's a bit harder to get around in the Bay Area,1
sp_14-03,Life is not as fast paced there even though it is Silicon Valley,1
sp_14-03,Okay I would say for living I prefer my hometown because it is much more laid back,1
sp_14-01,So yeah not really the best time to be doing this stuff but they are all about different things so,1
sp_03-12,It's part of life,1
sp_03-12,It's all in the mind if it's your daily routine is not pressure,1
sp_03-12,But I am glad for that now and I see our relatively philosophically you are only have as much pressure as you create by yourself,1
sp_03-12, I mean  my mother in particular was always pressurizing me to study a lot so I think I can take a break when I came to university,1
sp_03-12,And I am the oldest kid so I am supposed to earn and my brother can study and the pressure is there self created that way,1
sp_03-12,So our family is in middle of financial crunch,1
sp_03-12,But they tell me I must study because of financial concerns,1
sp_03-11,I don't know what to beat in last semester nor do I want to fail for the first time,1
sp_03-11,Graduation I am actually doubtful because of math,1
sp_03-11,And I am glad for that there is no space,1
sp_03-10b,So it's your propagative to go and talk with them,1
sp_03-10a,So as a kid is more difficult there than here,1
sp_03-10a,In India they overly concerned about you and judged you based on everything on first glance,1
sp_03-10a,And I think this university people don't care,1
sp_03-10a,And for somebody always top in the school it's very difficult to make friends,1
sp_03-09,In other majors you need to study post grad to be employable in any form but not in computer science,1
sp_03-09,So in other majors especially I mean I want to do engineering not business,1
sp_03-09,And it does not even give you one year to decide what you want to do,1
sp_03-09,It's kind of retarded system,1
sp_03-08,That's the deadline,1
sp_03-08,That and for math basically finished the syllabus because the professor gives no homework and incentive and I have to do it myself,1
sp_03-08,For COMP project whatever date is Tuesday Monday,1
sp_03-08,All the deadlines so for ELEC there is a homework deadline on 10 May,1
sp_03-07,And then in Hong Kong I have an interview left I mean I have startup interview with exactly with one firm right now,1
sp_03-07,I am well I am almost sorted getting an offer in India but I am not sure as it yet so I won't say anything about it,1
sp_03-07,I have applied Hong Kong and overseas,1
sp_03-07,I am looking for a job,1
sp_03-06,So yeah math,1
sp_03-06,There is FYP which I think it's nearly done over,1
sp_03-06,So even though I didn't go for classes,1
sp_03-06,We are all working hard and I am sure we can finish the code,1
sp_03-06,And math requires practice so I scared about that,1
sp_03-06,Not because it's actually difficult but because I did not paying attention in the classes and therefore I have to study in my own 10 days to pass the exam,1
sp_03-06,So I find my math course Game Theory the most difficult,1
sp_03-06,It's subjective,1
sp_03-06,It's you cannot rank them according to the difficulities in terms of absolute difficulty,1
sp_03-02,I went to Guangzhou for debate competition,1
sp_03-02,It was one of the previous 2 years,1
sp_03-02,It was  can't remember wait ,1
sp_03-02, No I actually streched that,1
sp_02-12,So sometimes I feel pressure from them,1
sp_02-12,My parents don't give me any pressure but most pressure come from my peers I guess,1
sp_02-11,So  it's really anxious for me,1
sp_02-11,I am not sure which one I am going to take finally,1
sp_02-11,I am pretty anxious about my future plan academic life for now because I have not got a super clear plan for what I am gonna do  after I went to Purdue,1
sp_02-10,That's a lot of questions,1
sp_02-09,So I usually talk to my friends and talk to professors when I was in trouble or when I was in difficulties,1
sp_02-09,So it's kind of difficult at first for me to adapt to the new environment,1
sp_02-09,I have to take attend lectures in English and did all of my homework in English,1
sp_02-09,So  since I have  took my highschool in Mainland China coming to Hong Kong is a completely different academic environment,1
sp_02-08,And there is another homework that I on May 9,1
sp_02-08,And before May 10 I got to finish my powerpoint for my presentation,1
sp_02-08,I am going to do my final year project presentation on May 10 and then my poster presentation on  May 12,1
sp_02-07,Consult several professors in person and see what I am going to do in the Fall semester,1
sp_02-07,So I may have to do it after I arrived at Purdue,1
sp_02-07,But I have not found a professor yet,1
sp_02-07,I am going to Purdue University in the place where I have my exchange program for a PhD program,1
sp_02-06,And the other one is Engineering Optics there are so many equations and is sometimes hard to memorize all of item and it's a closed book exam,1
sp_02-06,AI because there we have our system will ask question and user who want to answer question,1
sp_02-06,AI to build an interactive system  and the one our team are building may not be that fit to use in API,1
sp_02-06,The first one is ELEC4010i because we have to use the API,1
sp_02-06,Okay so  the 2 ELEC courses I am taking this semester are very difficult for me,1
sp_02-02,It's  it gives me a feeling of freedom that  that  Hong Kong it's does not have such of  there are more space there,1
sp_02-01,And I like it very much because it's about life just like what I am going through or what I will be going through in the future and it's very interesting and hillarious,1
sp_01-12,You can't be too bad at research and a bit low GPA so that is what keeps me moving forward and getting keep getting good grades,1
sp_01-12,So this actually a little bit stress,1
sp_01-11,So not a not anxious about these kind of thing,1
sp_01-11,And graduate school already gave me offer,1
sp_01-11,And employment you know probably I am going probably for PhD degree so it's I mean 5 years to worry about that and not that much,1
sp_01-11,I really anxious about it that much,1
sp_01-11,Well probably  relationships  a little bit because I don't have girl friend and you know your parents always ask you to get girl friend,1
sp_01-10,And among all my classmates there will be definitely someone you don't like or someone you hate,1
sp_01-09b,Well it's probably because HKUST is the highest ranked among the universities,1
sp_01-09b,That is the reason why I chose ECE and why HKUST,1
sp_01-09b,So and about jobs in the future a lot of jobs that the CS student will take an ECE student can also take that job,1
sp_01-09b,And another thing is that as an ECE student you also have to learn about programming so and also have get get an another chance to I mean study with the CS students,1
sp_01-09b,The first course of the ECE is Introduction to Elec Robot,1
sp_01-09b,And the HKUST admit admitted me and I have to come there for engineering and when I chose the major I was struggling between CS and ECE,1
sp_01-09b,So so the first is  when I enter this school I applied for engineering school actually I applied for engineering school in HKUST and business school in HKU,1
sp_01-09b,Why why I choose my current major,1
sp_01-08,Only a pass,1
sp_01-08,Really really very definitely a little bit stressed some way,1
sp_01-08,So actually actually I am stressed right now,1
sp_01-08,I have 4 deadlines in the next week and 1 and 1 FYP final year project presentation,1
sp_01-06,So yeah this course is actually very difficult,1
sp_01-06,So so you have to really have to learn from all of these areas,1
sp_01-06,So that make me feel a little bit stress and  well and another thing is that about this course the content is mixed of a lot of areas like NLP machine learning and and some some signal processing,1
sp_01-06,So as a ECE student I am actually I am not that familiar with programming comparing with those CS students,1
sp_01-06,So the most difficult one I think is a  is a ELEC4010i because it is actually a course for both COMP students CS students and ELEC students but it counts more on programming,1
sp_01-04,So why,1
sp_01-03,But in Hong Kong is like most people I don't know,1
sp_01-01,And because when you are watching movies don't want watch this just watch something that happen always happen around you,1
sp_01-01,And so for my favorite TV series or movies actually I like some Chinese one especially fantasy stories,1
sp_01-01,okay and for I don't really watch a lot of movies or TV series recently because you know I am busy with my study,1
s01308_16k.wav,Works going averagely but physics is um kind of difficult because I'm really behind and I wasn't expecting it to be as hard,1
s01307_16k.wav,I'd like to do an MBA at one point maybe two years after having a job,1
s01307_16k.wav,I'm not looking for a job right now because I'm year two but um looking for internships of for the summer,1
s01307_16k.wav,After graduating I'd like to get a job what type of job no clue hopefully something I have no idea um marketing based maybe,1
s01306_16k.wav,um I found accounting the most difficult out of them all I just didn't understand it at all um more difficult than finance,1
s01212_16k.wav,But at the same time they want they really want me to be happy so they never do too many pressure on me they always like try to to make me um serious in what I do,1
s01212_16k.wav,But at the same time to be realize like to be um yes to have to have lots of things to put in my CV to you know graduate in a good university to take good marks for my future life for my future job,1
s01212_16k.wav,Ok my parents yes have given me some pressure for the academic life because they want me to be happy,1
s01211_16k.wav,I have to do all my exam take good marks and uh try yes try to to have a good mark so so on my graduation day So that's the most scary things in my life,1
s01211_16k.wav,ok I'm I'm very an anxious about my academic life because when I come back to grad gradua graduate and um I am anxious about it,1
s01210_16k.wav,So yes um I am scared about it,1
s01210_16k.wav,And I am scared about group work because I know that Chinese people want to work a lot and um you don't have to be a freerider you have to work hard,1
s01210_16k.wav,You know I am Italian and I am very open and then sometimes it's not the the good no it's not a good things to do Here I like to talk talk talk and they don't want you to do it,1
s01210_16k.wav,It's um difficult here in China to to get along with chinese people here because they are very different from me,1
s01209_16k.wav,He helped me to choose the right university in Italy and then he like told me to choose to choose this university here in Hong Kong and it was it was a good choice,1
s01208_16k.wav,I have a lot to work for this exam and yes I have to start studying it,1
s01208_16k.wav,ok I have the the the recent work I have to do is um midtem on eleventh of october for yes like um logistic exam,1
s01207_16k.wav,So probably after this experience I have to go to work with him because this is my plan for the future so um yes that's what I want to do,1
s01207_16k.wav,um but my father also a company includes a company he produce here in China,1
s01207_16k.wav,ok my plan after graduation are to have like an experience in fashion firms because I want to work in fashion in particular marketing,1
s01206_16k.wav,So yes I prefer humanistic and management courses um and I think that finance financial courses are very difficult yea,1
s01206_16k.wav,ok I think that the most difficult courses are the finance courses here because all the Chinese people are very good with mathematics calculation and everything everthing about numbers and less good in in you know humanities and thinking talking,1
s01203_16k.wav,I think they are completely different so I cannot you know prefer one or each other,1
s01201_16k.wav,And you know everyone is you know thinking about himself If you know the the the difference normality and maddness is so not so clear,1
s01201_16k.wav,um o I can't I don't really remember or you may hear of it but it was a very good movie and ah it was quite terrify me because it was about madness,1
s01111_16k.wav,So um to the difficulty of of finding that passion is what I'm worried about right now,1
s01111_16k.wav,um I haven't really found um I haven't really discovered my passion for what I'm going for what I want in life,1
s01111_16k.wav,And so but but it's not like I've been trying to do anything about it either,1
s01111_16k.wav,But uh it it seems like they sort of dictate my life they I'm going to do what they want me to do one day,1
s01111_16k.wav,Well right now it's a lack of direction that's my biggest issue right now because all all all my life I've been doing what my parents wanted and it's it's all turned out well I'm not complaining or anything,1
s01111_16k.wav,The types of things that I'm anxious about,1
s01110_16k.wav,uh None of my close friends are locals because in a in a way it's difficult to uh properly bond with them,1
s01110_16k.wav,But still not to not to a very satisfactory extent because um I can I can I can speak to them but uh none of them are my close friends,1
s01110_16k.wav,But in university you learn about things that you that you would never ever have know before,1
s01110_16k.wav,You meet people from all walks of life that you would never have gotten a chance to know in high school,1
s01110_16k.wav,Because the people you meet are so much more varied,1
s01109_16k.wav,And that's why they sent me to Hong Kong to study,1
s01109_16k.wav,And so they think that to study in the country that your going to work in has lots of benefits,1
s01109_16k.wav, uh Because my parents I was born in Hong Kong and my parents are from China and in the end they want me they would like me to work in in China or in Hong Kong one day,1
s01109_16k.wav,uh I came to this university because my parents my parents wanted me to again,1
s01109_16k.wav, I'm staying on a whole different continent from my parents,1
s01109_16k.wav,But mostly it's very Hong Kong is very different to South Africa I mean my parents are in South Africa,1
s01109_16k.wav,um,1
s01109_16k.wav,But a lot of them are mostly superifical friends so sort of not superficial as in like they're very materialistic,1
s01109_16k.wav,uh How I'm adapting to college life Well this is this is very multilayered,1
s01107_16k.wav,And that so that's always been their plan for me,1
s01107_16k.wav,And maybe couple of years of of work experience in between but they do want me to study until I get my PhD because then they think that your your starting point is just higher than evrybody else,1
s01107_16k.wav, That my parents want me to get uh get my masters and they want me to study until I get my PhD and then and then start working,1
s01107_16k.wav,And and so so there's nothing that I want the there's no game  there's no goal or aim for me right now it's just the concept that maybe in the future,1
s01107_16k.wav,What line of profession I'd like to go into But my parents what they would like is for me to carry on studying after  after my undergrad degree but I'm currently in year one now so I don't have any offer for for further studying,1
s01107_16k.wav,My plan after graduation well I'm not really clear about that because I I don't even know what I would like to do in the future,1
s01105_16k.wav,But I do not know how to make it um because um I just never learn to cook and my mother can't cook either so uh so I had nowhere to learn it from,1
s01105_16k.wav,I can't take any spice at all,1
s01012_16k.wav,And also my friends gave me a little bit pressure that's called peer pressure yeah but I try to deal with that right now,1
s01012_16k.wav,uh Yes my parents gave me a lot of pressure because I'm the only child in the family and they have a lot of expectations on me,1
s01011_16k.wav,I'm more anxious about my finanical status because being an independent woman in such a materialistic society is not that easy,1
s01010_16k.wav,um But definitely I prefer Hong Kong over my home town because this is a more global society for me and I meet different groups of people from everywhere,1
s01010_16k.wav,And I think I would have not that many difficulties in intergrating into Hong Kong society,1
s01010_16k.wav,uh You need to express yourself very clearly and try to understand others uh from their perspective,1
s01010_16k.wav,um I think communications play a very important role in helping me to get along with other people,1
s01008_16k.wav, And it will take uh approximately nine months for me to graduate and I don't have to write a paper so no difficulty for that and no recent exams,1
s01008_16k.wav,I think it's a little difficult but I just need to read through the textbook,1
s01007_16k.wav,um I probably don't want to study further I want to continue working here in Hong Kong,1
s01007_16k.wav,So it's pretty hard to stand out in that sense,1
s01007_16k.wav, And my weakness for uh looking for jobs I think it comes down to my academic record because here in Hong Kong things are very competitive and people around me they're all having very good academic records,1
s01007_16k.wav,And so far I haven't got any interview yet and but I think I'm well prepared for the interviews especially for the case crack for um consulting management firms,1
s01007_16k.wav,um Yes currently I'm looking for a graduation job,1
s01006_16k.wav,I think econometrics in uh UST is very hard because it involves a lot of lot of math,1
s00912_16k.wav,But because I know I'm not really good with numbers I'm scared to actually go into that area or to study it but other than like those academic things I they don't really give me them other kinds of pressure,1
s00910_16k.wav,But I guess I'll always be the foreigner um I definitely prefer Seoul than Hong Kong because Hong I find Hong Kong too small and crowded and I do have close friends here,1
s00910_16k.wav,But I don't really hang out with them I think I can integrate into Hong Kong society maybe,1
s00907_16k.wav,I think it will be a bit hard for me to find a job because I don't really have any concrete work experience or internship experience but I'm not too stressed about it right now,1
s00907_16k.wav,I don't really have a concrete plan after graduation,1
s00906_16k.wav,um I think the most difficult course I'm taking this semester is this econ course it's called industrial organisation and competitor strategy and it's difficult because I don't like math and it involves a lot of math,1
s00905_16k.wav,I know how to make it but it's quite complicated and I've never never done it without my mum,1
s00812_16k.wav,My parents don't give me that much stress because I don't talk to them that much on the phone but when I do I feel like I I should study so yeah,1
s00812_16k.wav,My friends give me pressure when they study in the library and I don't so I feel bad for that,1
s00811_16k.wav,I'm anxious about my academic life employment and relationships because empolyment is hard to look for right now relationshps is also hard and academic life is something I can do but I just don't feel like doing right now,1
s00808_16k.wav,Recent work is not going very good since I've no motivation to start studyin but my midterms is coming soon so i'll study soon,1
s00807_16k.wav,I don't have an inteview on going recently but after a couple of years of experience I do wanna do MBA in United States and my weakness would probably be my lack of work experience in my resume but I do have good communication skills,1
s00807_16k.wav,After graduation I I wanna look for a job and right now it's not going very well but I'm sure in 3rd year it will be better,1
s00806_16k.wav,um I think finance and accounting courses are the most difficult because it requires a lot of application and a lot of theories,1
s00712_16k.wav,um my parents did give me some pressure they they always ask me like what kind of grades did I get during the exams or stuff like that um yeah,1
s00711_16k.wav,um im more anxious about my maybe love life because im being quite busy with my academic life and i haven't devote much of time like relationship stuff like that so yeah,1
s00710_16k.wav,I prefer my home town still but I still like Hong Kong yup,1
s00708_16k.wav,And I haven't began writing a paper,1
s00708_16k.wav,um The thing I find difficult is I have to um to work on presentation in a group so it's kind of hard to cooperate um and it will take a week oh  it will take it take me one more year to graduate,1
s00708_16k.wav,I've not that much to catch one deadline next week and yeah a lot  in the coming month,1
s00708_16k.wav,um My work is doing fine,1
s00707_16k.wav,um I want to go for further studies after graduation po possibly do a Phd studies um in either America or the Europe,1
s00706_16k.wav,um i think the math course is the most difficult because um im not good at math so yeah difficult for me,1
s00612_16k.wav,But like I don't really hang out with them so i think that's fine,1
s00611_16k.wav,I'm trying to fix that but I'm not sure if that's going to happen,1
s00611_16k.wav,But um I really don't know if I can get into one or two this year so I'm kind of nervous about that and think about that a lot um,1
s00611_16k.wav,um I'm kind of anxious about my academic life because I'm applying for graduate school right now and like the offer thing didn't go very well I'm still waiting for that,1
s00610_16k.wav,I don't really talk to local people because most of people from Hong Kong they don't really have the same value as I did so like normally I don't talk to them,1
s00609_16k.wav,I'm not sure after a while if it is still interesting or not,1
s00609_16k.wav,NAME,1
s00608_16k.wav,um I think I didn't have enough time to do that so I'm just kind of finish it up and like not really pay a lot of attention to that,1
s00608_16k.wav,um I think I kind of write a wrote a paper last month but it's not like a serious paper it's like a student paper contest,1
s00608_16k.wav,But for some of the tasks i have no idea where to start,1
s00608_16k.wav,The work didn't go very well recently because um I've got a lot to do,1
s00607_16k.wav,So i think I'm just going to be waiting for the offer and see what happens next,1
s00607_16k.wav,But um I mean masters sounds better than like a five year commission for this,1
s00607_16k.wav,um I wanted to do a masters first and then PhD because I'm not really sure what im trying to do,1
s00607_16k.wav,I I think i'm going to apply for a graduate school after this i didn't get i didn't get any offer yet but hopefully I should get like one or two somehow sometimes,1
s00606_16k.wav,Ah i think the most difficult course right now for like these 3 years are is machine learning I took that course for like three or four classes and i dropped it because I can't really understand what they're talking about in the class,1
s00512_16k.wav,um my mother is a hippie so there is absolutely no pressure for grade or financial pressure,1
s00511_16k.wav,ah Employment is really stressful right now because I really need to find a job and I don't seem to get one,1
s00510_16k.wav,um I don't really get along with local students but I really like mainland students,1
s00509_16k.wav,I want to go back home really badly,1
s00509_16k.wav,I am not really adapting well to college life,1
s00508_16k.wav,ah Studying right now is not really easy and I have all these assignments to do and I don't really know how to do it,1
s00507_16k.wav,You have all these interview and ah it's not really easy to get a job in the investment banking industry,1
s00507_16k.wav,ah I would looking for a job is really hard,1
s00506_16k.wav,um the hardest course here is econometrics because nobody can succeed and have a good grade,1
s00503_16k.wav,There's not a lot of things to do and it's pretty boring and I definitely prefer Hong Kong,1
s00411_16k.wav,I am most anxious about academic life especially the midterms and finals because everyone says it's hard to keep up good grades,1
s00410_16k.wav,It's hard to interact with the local students and hardest to interact with mainland Chinese students,1
s00408_16k.wav,There are many deadlines coming up especially with homework assignments but the most stressful are the tests and quizzes every week that we have in various subject,1
s00407_16k.wav,After gradation I'd like to find a work in an actuarial firm in Canada um in an entry level position and work my way through the actuarial exams,1
s00406_16k.wav,Sometimes the teacher laughs is less than eduational,1
s00406_16k.wav,We go through the materials very quickly,1
s00406_16k.wav,The most difficult course right now is Physics 011,1
s00308_16k.wav,Well so far work has been going alright but there are a lot of deadlines uh coming up and midterm exams are also coming up so it's quite uh getting quite hectic and busy,1
s00307_16k.wav,But um perhaps if I don't get a job after graduation then I'll go for further studies somewhere abroad like Canada or America,1
s00307_16k.wav,No I'm not looking for a job yet as I'm only in year two,1
s00211_16k.wav,Things I'm anxious about mostly academic life like just getting graduation done with graduation and getting good grades is my priority at the moment,1
s00208_16k.wav,uh yeah I have a lot of assignments that are due this week actually,1
s00208_16k.wav,Exams no exams yet but they are all on the way,1
s00208_16k.wav,and I haven't been writing a paper as I said I'm still in year 2 so probably will be doing it in my final year,1
s00208_16k.wav,uh for me to graduate I'm in year 2 so it will take me another year before I graduate,1
s00208_16k.wav,Work is fine I've got a lot of but I've got a lot of dead like deadlines and assignments quizzes midterms are coming up,1
s00207_16k.wav,Is it hard to find a job Yes it's hard because a lot of the companies don't recruit graduate students or those still in university still studying,1
s00207_16k.wav,As I said the preparation is fine and it's it it takes a long time to practice all the skills needed to go and give an interview,1
s00207_16k.wav,And for interviews no I haven't gone for any interviews recently,1
s00207_16k.wav,For looking for a job I haven't really done much pre I've only been preparing like interview skills and writing out my CV my resume,1
s00206_16k.wav,For courses I don't I don't I find Finance course the most difficult because it's math based and I don't like doing math,1
s00111_16k.wav,I'm mostly anxious about my future employment and uh yeah my academic life as well,1
s00109_16k.wav,Marketing is interesting cause um it's all about perceptions and interpretations of different consumers which I find very interesting,1
s00109_16k.wav,Mainly cause I've always been fond of Econ as a subject and um,1
s00109_16k.wav,um I chose my major to study which is uh planning um I'm planning to do a double major in Econ and Marketing,1
s00108_16k.wav,And it is fairly hard,1
s00108_16k.wav,This is the university of stress and tension,1
s00108_16k.wav,um I do have a lot of homework as usual,1
s00108_16k.wav,But um I have begun writing a paper and I actually did quite well in it even though I wasn't a hundred percent sure about what I was writing about,1
s00108_16k.wav,I do have quite a few deadlines in the next week and um not there there's nothing I find difficult in particular,1
s00107_16k.wav,In terms of communication I have uh stage fright,1
s00107_16k.wav,In the sense that I sometimes I have days where I don't always put in a hundred percent as I should do,1
s00107_16k.wav,My weakness in uh work experience or uh communication is that during my work experience I find it quite hard to uh fully commit myself to the job,1
s00106_16k.wav,The reasons I find them difficult is cause they involve a hefty amount of maths in a form that I don't particularly like or um understand to the best of my knowledge,1
s00106_16k.wav,Okay the courses I find most difficult are Econ and Accounting,1
s02512_16k.wav,And I also get pressures from friends peers  it's  I can cooperate it that's not a big deal,1
s02512_16k.wav,Mostly towards to studying like I have to study hard and get good grades,1
s02512_16k.wav,Well I got a lot pressure from my parents,1
s02511_16k.wav,Relationship and love life  well that's just keep coming and going,1
s02511_16k.wav,What kind of things I am anxious about  Mostly academic life getting good grades and stuff employment does one of the issues which I have don't know what I get,1
s02510_16k.wav, Well of course I prefer my hometown and the  I have few close friends here mostly international student,1
s02510_16k.wav,I get along with local students eh there is a bit communication gap but it's not a big problem,1
s02510_16k.wav,I am get along with people quite well  compared to high school I think you know college life is much better more glamorous,1
s02508_16k.wav,um I don't have any homework that's not that hard,1
s02508_16k.wav,And I like nc tritety nc which is one of the exam and it's very difficult,1
s02508_16k.wav,I  It should take one year to graduate and I  have like three exams next week two of them on Monday,1
s02508_16k.wav,The study is going fine just finish my last homework eh yesterday just before deadline,1
s02507_16k.wav,Mostly MPhil  maybe at HKUST or any other universities abroad,1
s02507_16k.wav,I am given much a  consideration to the plan after graduation but I I fell most doing further study,1
s02506_16k.wav,And it's like nc dear God nc how much difficult,1
s02506_16k.wav,Why's difficult I haven't had anything like this before,1
s02412_16k.wav,So this is a kind of pressure that I am facing,1
s02412_16k.wav,But uh yeah all my friends are truly supportive they they can know what I want they always try to help me to get whatever I want,1
s02412_16k.wav,I don't know everything else means,1
s02412_16k.wav,But  apart of that they are really supportive to  to everything else,1
s02412_16k.wav,Yeah my parents put pressure on me in a different way has a they expect from me which I don't plan to do like getting a job and settling down life getting marriage soon things like that,1
s02410_16k.wav,They don't talk a lot,1
s02409_16k.wav,And uh  yeah college life in Hong Kong is good except for the fact people would not talk except my labs mate are very friendly,1
s02409_16k.wav,Because I think Computer Science is more logical compared to EE,1
s02409_16k.wav,uh I am basically an Electrical Engineering student but I like Computer Science more,1
s02409_16k.wav,ah I actually chose a wrong major to study which I think I realize three years into it,1
s02409_16k.wav,I came to this university by mailing my professor which it kind of wierd,1
s02408_16k.wav,No I haven't written  my paper yet but I got the date already so I need to start writing,1
s02408_16k.wav,uh I still don't know how long it would take to graduate and hopefully I would graduate by December,1
s02408_16k.wav,Yep the thing I find difficult is to run experiments and write the results and the way that's interesting for everyone,1
s02408_16k.wav,Ya I got deadline on June first,1
s02407_16k.wav,And  I want a go for a PhD in the US uh  a different school or if not the same school in that I have done in my Master and trying to do the same kind of work,1
s02407_16k.wav, I didn't get an offer for a PhD so I don't know how long would it take to graduate but I am plan to finish my MPhil  in couple of years,1
s02407_16k.wav,I think it's a lot of fun  and I think everyone who's interested  in technology should go ahead and  do uh higher degree course in that,1
s02407_16k.wav,uh I don't find anything particularly really hard in studying,1
s02407_16k.wav,uh Yes that's was one of the places that I want to work especially because Dekai is a good professor in the domain of computational linguistics,1
s02407_16k.wav,My plan is to study further for graduation,1
s02403_16k.wav,So it's more emotional than objective attachment to the place,1
s02401_16k.wav,More specificly it's about the american system bureaucracy and  how people face a lot of difficulities for trying to do something good,1
s02312_16k.wav,But  the thing is my responsibility,1
s02311_16k.wav,Just do well and thats enough,1
s02311_16k.wav,I am stressing too much about it,1
s02311_16k.wav,My academic life I think is alright,1
s02311_16k.wav,My future employment,1
s02311_16k.wav,So I am that uh quite worried about,1
s02311_16k.wav,ah And I haven't start looking about job,1
s02311_16k.wav,I don't where I gonna end up what kind of field,1
s02311_16k.wav,I am quite anxious about ah future job,1
s02310_16k.wav,And but I don't think I can integrate into Hong Kong society because you have to be borned in Hong Kong laughs,1
s02309_16k.wav,And I think Engineering is  is quite demanded in the market like job market,1
s02309_16k.wav,um My adaptation college life is alright,1
s02308_16k.wav,And yeah I have a lot of homeworks left,1
s02308_16k.wav,The most difficult one is gonna be speech recognition exam,1
s02308_16k.wav,I haven't had any exams yet but all of them are coming soon  in the next two weeks,1
s02308_16k.wav,And I am not gonna write any paper,1
s02308_16k.wav,It would take me one more year  to graduation,1
s02308_16k.wav,um I find two courses difficult ah one is HUMA three three and one is ELEC three o eight,1
s02308_16k.wav,I have a lot of deadlines homeworks assignments stuff like that,1
s02308_16k.wav,um Recent work is not going well,1
s02307_16k.wav,I have for further studies I plan to go to  ah Finance or Mathematical Finance or something related to Finance,1
s02307_16k.wav,um So I haven't had get any internship experience or  professional knowledge,1
s02307_16k.wav,It's just like translator,1
s02307_16k.wav,I have some jobs before  but it's not related to my  ah degree,1
s02307_16k.wav,And I haven't gotten any interviews,1
s02307_16k.wav,I am not looking for a job  because  I think  I have to study first,1
s02307_16k.wav,Right now I have two  ah plans of of the graduation while one of them is to go to Beijing and learn Chinese for one year  or to do master school in States or Europe,1
s02306_16k.wav,So I don't I can't find time to do all these works,1
s02306_16k.wav,And too many lecture notes and homeworks and everything,1
s02306_16k.wav,And I  I am struggling and nervous now because I don't know how to study for the final,1
s02306_16k.wav,And um a lot of work,1
s02306_16k.wav,I find very difficult a lot of programming  which is not my stress,1
s02306_16k.wav,I think elective three is the most difficult course laughs,1
s02212_16k.wav,So I would say it's quite stressful it that sense,1
s02212_16k.wav,So when you are around smart people and they do well and you kind of want do well and you didn't do well,1
s02212_16k.wav,But there's something called the peer pressure,1
s02212_16k.wav,So I keep it to myself,1
s02212_16k.wav,I which is why sometimes when they greet that out I would definitely not go up to their or call them and tell them that I did bad in the exam,1
s02212_16k.wav,I guess sometimes living up to their expectation can be tough,1
s02212_16k.wav,I think they expect a lot from me,1
s02212_16k.wav,But I guess I'm under a lot of pressure from my  parents,1
s02211_16k.wav,Oh no,1
s02211_16k.wav,Things that I am anxious about it's a lot of things,1
s02209_16k.wav,And the  right now I will be graduating so I am not looking back and complaining or what,1
s02209_16k.wav,But I guess like living in Hong Kong for three years I have adapted to  their need and the expections that  they expect from me,1
s02209_16k.wav,College live is fun  and it can be  it can be pretty tough at times,1
s02208_16k.wav,And then the exam review I need to catch on that too,1
s02208_16k.wav,But ah I have homework due which is coming out,1
s02208_16k.wav,I have four exams  which is not too bad considering I am in my final year,1
s02208_16k.wav,Well it's pretty intensive pretty tough,1
s02208_16k.wav,I have deadlines to meet and final exams are coming after this,1
s02208_16k.wav,My recent work ah  it's going not too good,1
s02207_16k.wav,And then I have planned on doing Masters or PhD hopefully in US or Canada,1
s02207_16k.wav,Which is gonna last like one  ah twelve months,1
s02207_16k.wav,But ah right now I am planned to do small internship for one year,1
s02207_16k.wav,After graduation  seriously I had  I had a lot thinking to do,1
s02206_16k.wav,And the assignments are pretty tough especially for ELEC courses,1
s02206_16k.wav,Why ah There're a lot of coursework  a lot of reading to be done,1
s02206_16k.wav,I think Finance courses are quite challenging  too,1
s02206_16k.wav,ah Over the course of three years in UST I was also taking courses in Finance,1
s02206_16k.wav,I think ah some of the ELEC electives are quite difficult,1
s02112_16k.wav,I don't give a shit,1
s02111_16k.wav,Relationships love life well it's more the lack of love life that I am anxious about maybe so but I wouldn't use the word anxious I think it's a pretty strong word,1
s02110_16k.wav,And uh well of course I can say that getting along with local students I'm not very good at it but I know that most international students here they don't get along with local students that well,1
s02108_16k.wav,uh So my recent work is actually not going that well because its the beginning of the semester its always hard to get start again after the summer,1
s02107_16k.wav,uh I  I don't want to study anymore because I'm really fed up with studying so I really want to start working,1
s02107_16k.wav,Wo it would be nice to somehow practice my Mandarin more and um I don't know I hope I can work for a smaller company where they give more responsibility,1
s02107_16k.wav,uh After my graduation I hope I can find some sort of job in Mainland China because I lived in Shanghai for two years,1
s02106_16k.wav,uh For me in university I would say that any course involving numbers are the most difficult because I suck at math,1
s02103_16k.wav,And in the winter of course it gets really cold and we have a lot of snow so thats why I moved to Hong Kong because I hate the weather there,1
s02012_16k.wav,My parents and friends I guess they do give me some pressure especially my mom I need to study harder and everything,1
s02011_16k.wav,Uh I don't really  I'm not really worried about uh employment or academic life but it is mostly about my future,1
s02011_16k.wav,And that totally you know ruins everything,1
s02011_16k.wav,At the moment um one thing I am very anxious about is going  going to army of course,1
s02010_16k.wav,Ah my hometown is  well I still prefer Korea than Hong Kong I guess,1
s02010_16k.wav,I think both has its you know positive and negatives but I do also have many international friends as well,1
s02010_16k.wav,Um But I don't know which one is better,1
s02010_16k.wav,Ah I do not know how but maybe it is because I have girlfriend and I always hang out with Korean friends,1
s02010_16k.wav,But compared to high school ah in here I'm kind of limit  limited to um like Korean society,1
s02010_16k.wav,Ah I get along with other people very well,1
s02008_16k.wav,And I will be very stressed out,1
s02008_16k.wav,Um uh Not exams yet but it will be  it will come,1
s02008_16k.wav,Um I think and also it will take at least three years for me to graduate because  no actually four years because I have to do the military service,1
s02008_16k.wav,Um My recent work was ah finance team project and the deadline is tomorrow and uh we are having some difficulties ah dealing some of the questions,1
s02007_16k.wav,So that's not my weakness,1
s02007_16k.wav,Well I guess I have  I will um have professional knowledge and skills ah as I study,1
s02007_16k.wav,I haven't done any internship so far um,1
s02007_16k.wav,Yeah my weakness is um lacking working experiences internship experiences of course,1
s02007_16k.wav,Ah I guess it's not so hard to find a job but its will be very stressful to you know to all the interviews and you know um yeah,1
s02007_16k.wav,Ah No interview no preparation at all,1
s02007_16k.wav,Um But I guess when I'm back from army I think I will be start uh looking for a job,1
s02007_16k.wav,So I'm really stressed,1
s02007_16k.wav,Right now I'm not I'm not looking for a job because man I have to go to army first,1
s02006_16k.wav,And it's really boring and I feel really stressed every time I need to do study,1
s02006_16k.wav,ah The course I think the most difficult is um Accounting and Finance cause I'm in Finance major so I have to do Accounting again,1
s01912_16k.wav,uh My mother wants me to move back to Europe after graduation uh which is also something I have to take into account for employment issues,1
s01912_16k.wav,My parents give me a lot of pressure,1
s01911_16k.wav,And uh Relationships is also something I think about,1
s01911_16k.wav,What my grade average will be which will again limit the employ employment options,1
s01911_16k.wav,Secondly it's the academics uh I'm also worried about,1
s01911_16k.wav,uh Number one being employment after graduation,1
s01911_16k.wav,uh Currently I'm very anxious about several things,1
s01910_16k.wav,um Hong Kong's society is very hard to integrate to uh as a foreigner but I'm getting by day by day,1
s01908_16k.wav,Recent work is uh hard to focus on because um job applications are taking  is taking up so much time uh making it hard to focus on current work,1
s01907_16k.wav,uh After working I will probably do the GMAT and GRE I have it in the back of my head but I'm not doing it right now,1
s01907_16k.wav,Further studies is something I've been thinking about doing two years after working,1
s01907_16k.wav,Application deadlines are very tense and I have to finish them within a month of my first uh semester of my final year,1
s01907_16k.wav,And I uh start doing my applications uh online this semester,1
s01907_16k.wav,Okay um I am looking for a job uh within the finance sector,1
s01907_16k.wav,I need to find a job and that's uh very important for me,1
s01907_16k.wav,My plan after graduation is to uh look for a job um so that I can pay uh for my bills,1
s01906_16k.wav,I find the finance classes to be the most difficult because of the quantitative aspect and the competition within the class from other students,1
s01902_16k.wav,Hong Kong is a lot more expensive than Beijing,1
s01812_16k.wav,And also a little bit from my girlfriend because obviously uh she  she wants to have a boyfriend that a reliable in the future,1
s01812_16k.wav,But uh I think my relatives have because they  they've been constantly asking me uh what I'm going to do after my  uh after graduating,1
s01811_16k.wav,uh The  the mo  ah the most I'm worried about is uh for my final grade and also about uh my  my future prospects because I'm not sure exactly right now wether I'm going to be joining a workforce or wether I'll be continuing my further studies,1
s01810_16k.wav,But I do prefer a place that has more English culture,1
s01810_16k.wav,uh I don't think I did as well  uh compared to high school because uh during high school a lot of us came from the same background because a lot of us were uh Chinese people and then we lived abroad and then we came back,1
s01809_16k.wav,and uh  and also uh why did I come to Hong Kong Is because uh um I had a financial difficulty with my family and if I stayed in Hong Kong it would be a lot cheaper,1
s01809_16k.wav,I think ah uh initially I adapted very poorly to college life because I didn't know a lot of people and I really didn't embrace the Cantonese culture,1
s01808_16k.wav,um I have started to study for some of my exams because I know its  all my exams and midterms will be bunched in a group,1
s01808_16k.wav,um I haven't started any of my uh writing for my FYP,1
s01808_16k.wav,I think it would take me another  about a year uh maybe a bit less to  to graduate,1
s01808_16k.wav,And uh also I have to communicate with uh  with my FYP partner as well and its a bit frustrating sometimes because of the time difference,1
s01808_16k.wav,uh I have  I have a lot of deadlines to do uh for my FYP etc also I have a lot of homeworks that I have to do,1
s01807_16k.wav,uh What's my hardest uh place for studying I think the hardest would uh again be the mathematical side of everything,1
s01807_16k.wav,uh I think my weaknesses would be my work experience and also my internship experience,1
s01807_16k.wav,uh I think it's actually hard to find job because thethere is a lot of people who are much better suited to the type of jobs I'm  I'm trying to look for,1
s01807_16k.wav,But uh an uh so I don't have any preparation,1
s01807_16k.wav,uh I haven't done any uh interviews,1
s01807_16k.wav,um I have  haven't started looking for a job,1
s01807_16k.wav,But if that doesn't turn out uh probably then I will probably do uh  start finding a job,1
s01807_16k.wav,My initial for after graduation would be to uh find  find a place where I could do my graduate studies,1
s01806_16k.wav,The reason is uh I think my skill set would be more of uh dealing with uh concepts instead of mathematical models,1
s01806_16k.wav,I think the most difficult courses are the ones that uh deal with a lot of equations a lot of different mathematical concepts,1
s01712_16k.wav,My father actually gives me a lot of pressure because uh he wants me to do as good as uh he did when he was a student,1
s01711_16k.wav,What I'm actually anxious about for the moment uh is my academic life,1
s01708_16k.wav,I have to send in a ten page written report,1
s01708_16k.wav,um The closest deadline I have to catch is the deadline for my uh PG course,1
s01707_16k.wav,um it actually takes five years uh  the normal time yeah for PhD uh is five years but I you probably can finish in four or three years if you're really good,1
s01707_16k.wav,uh I have not received an offer yet and what I find the hardest in studying is to write a paper or report,1
s01706_16k.wav,Well uh for this semester I actually think that all my courses are difficult especially the um PG course I'm taking,1
s01612_16k.wav,But what  uh but I do get my own pressure for example just academic pressure or maybe pressure from peer pressure maybe or pressure from my girlfriend,1
s01611_16k.wav,Um when it comes to life I'm anxious about everything because you don't know what is going to happen you can't predict the outcome so here it asks me employment academic life relationship love life of course I'm nervous about that who isn't,1
s01610_16k.wav,When it comes to local students they are a bit hard to get in touch to because they already have their group of friends so  but I try  I try integrating into Hong Kong societies  uh local society by joining their events etc,1
s01608_16k.wav,And I do have deadlines to catch which is my first assignment from uh finance which is next week,1
s01608_16k.wav,uh Summer is over and to be  um its really hard getting it  getting back into that working routine and mood because I had such a great summer with no work at all,1
s01607_16k.wav,Uh it's uh pretty hard to find a job um because specially in Hong Kong it's such a competitive market and everyones looking for jobs the unemployment rate is pretty high and it's just you know it's hard,1
s01607_16k.wav,And without preparing about well tell you what it's all about looking up the company websites updating  updated on the news of what's happening press conferences etc,1
s01607_16k.wav,I've sent around fifty uh copies of resumes to companies and I've got interview offers from six of them,1
s01607_16k.wav,I've been looking for jobs uh been going through jobDB newspapers and through my parents but um it's coming pretty good,1
s01606_16k.wav,And I get even more stressed than I am now so just sucks yeah,1
s01606_16k.wav,and I just can't cope it when I see a large batch of numbers right in my face like I panic and freak out I don't know what to do,1
s01606_16k.wav,I personally think that financing is one of the most difficult courses because I just hate numbers realistically,1
s01605_16k.wav,So yeah it's not good,1
s01605_16k.wav,But right now I've been really unhealthy and stuffing myself with McDonald,1
s01603_16k.wav,I mean I recommend everyone having a life but it's kind of hard when you have so much work in university,1
s01603_16k.wav,Huh well my hometown it's Hong Kong but you know Hong Kong it's um really stressful and look at look at this uni Hong Kong University of Stress and Tension,1
s01602_16k.wav,So you know no trips for me,1
s01601_16k.wav,I've been stuck in the library revising,1
s01601_16k.wav,I haven't seen any good movies lately,1
s01511_16k.wav,I need to have a good academic life  I mean I should do well in my studies and as well as the extra curricular activities to have a good job,1
s01511_16k.wav,Well I'm anxious about both my academic life and employment because bor are  both are interrelated,1
s01510_16k.wav,And its very difficult to choose from in between my uh hometown and Hong Kong because every place has it's own value and different criterias,1
s01510_16k.wav,It's always very difficult for me to integrate in the Hong Kong society because of their culture  cultural and the rituals,1
s01510_16k.wav,Its quite difficult to get along with the local students because there's a communication problem but if when you  when you like  in the university for quite long its  its used to for you,1
s01509_16k.wav,Preferably the automotives,1
s01509_16k.wav,I came to this university because it's rank quite high in engineering and I chose my major as mechanical because I have a deep interest in the in the machines,1
s01509_16k.wav,I've got used to the regulations and the working systems in my college,1
s01509_16k.wav,I It's my second year in my college,1
s01508_16k.wav,uh I have my exams like after two weeks and I need to put in a lot of effort to   well in them and I na have a lot of homework too,1
s01508_16k.wav,I have two more years to graduate,1
s01508_16k.wav,I have It's my second year,1
s01508_16k.wav,The mechanical courses actually um are the toughest for me because they involve a lot of thinking,1
s01508_16k.wav,um Recently I have a lot of presentations and projects which I need to work upon,1
s01507_16k.wav,um My plan after graduation is to look for a job in um company like um  which is generally related to automotive and after that I would pursue  I would like to pursue my master's which could be in the US,1
s01506_16k.wav,The course which I find the most difficult in my na college are the mechanical core courses because they require a lot of brainstorming and a lot of hard work to be put in,1
s01411_16k.wav,Um in the university I'm actually most anxious about my academic life because uh I really want to do well so that later on I can get a good job over here and have a good future,1
s01410_16k.wav,Between my hometown and Hong Kong uh it's really tough to choose which one I would prefer but I like all the aspects of the places and I have really close friends over here and they help me a lot,1
s01410_16k.wav,Uh the local students initially I found it hard to talk to them but uh slowly and slowly due due to like cultural events and all other stuff I got mixed with these people and enjoyed a lot,1
s01408_16k.wav,Um I have exams in like two or three weeks time uh and apart from that theres also a lot of homework and other stuff,1
s01408_16k.wav,Uh I've not begun writing any paper as of now,1
s01408_16k.wav,I'm in my second year at the moment so it will take me two years more to graduate,1
s01408_16k.wav,um I particularly find uh the electronics course's assignments the most difficult because they involve a lot of thought and lot of energy,1
s01408_16k.wav,I have a  I have like  I have almost two assignment submissions every week,1
s01408_16k.wav,Um I'm really busy at the moment I've got lots of homeworks and assignment submissions,1
s01407_16k.wav,Uh for further study I would like to apply to some uh  some graduate schools in the  probably in the US or UK um I have still not got any offer as of now uh but I wish to study over there,1
s01407_16k.wav,Yeah my plan after graduation is to either work in some telecom firm or some firm dealing with microprocessors and other stuff like that,1
s01406_16k.wav,I think all the electronics courses in HKUST are very difficult because there is lot of workload in them lot of assignments and stuff,1
sp_23-12,So no peer pressure and no parent pressure keep there,0
sp_23-12,But I really tend to do whatever I want I don't like to be a stuff by whatever other people think,0
sp_23-12,And if someone questions that I made my thing and I might consider that for next time,0
sp_23-12,I just do whatever I want,0
sp_23-12,I don't feel any peer pressure normally because I tend to live the way I want to live,0
sp_23-12,So it was not pressure for me it was like the best advice ever,0
sp_23-12,Industrial engineering tends to do every things,0
sp_23-12,But he has a lot he is also he is also good at computer science,0
sp_23-12,That's why I asked him because,0
sp_23-12,He is a professor in industrial engineering,0
sp_23-12,Well I just asked my dad for advice on it because he teaches industrial engineering,0
sp_23-11,I just hope I am lucky enough to be in the right place and the right time,0
sp_23-11,So yeah,0
sp_23-11,I think that's luck,0
sp_23-10,But I think I have blended into different communities that is not local but that is international and Korean,0
sp_23-10,But I do like to hangout with a lot of international students my friends many of my good friends are actually international students,0
sp_23-10,And most of friends are Koreans,0
sp_23-10,And so do I,0
sp_23-10,Korean hangout with Korean in this school,0
sp_23-10,It same goes here,0
sp_23-10,And same in Korea Korean hangout with Korean,0
sp_23-10,Locals hangout tend hangout with themselves only,0
sp_23-10,If you say about the local society I think most Korean will feel alinated for bit including myself,0
sp_23-09,So I want to  relief the financial stress on my families,0
sp_23-09,And what about why I choose Hong Kong as my university it's really simple I just got I just got a scholarship offer,0
sp_23-09,And that's why he said computer science and I never regret it and it's been very interesting and I think it's really  the best one of the best choice in my life to choose this instead of IELM,0
sp_23-09,But then I asked my dad and then he told me that IELM is kind of a it's decreasing trend these days so yeah,0
sp_23-09,I mean I already have it in my mind but I was wondering whether I should do IELM or computer science,0
sp_23-09,So I chose to do computer science mainly because my dad told me to do so,0
sp_23-09,About  about why I chose my major as computer science,0
sp_23-09,I didn't realize that I actually improved more English in this stage but yeah it did especially on my speech and writing,0
sp_23-09,And I think my English has acually improved a lot since I came to UST because I hanged out a lot with international friends,0
sp_23-09,Not the professor teach so well but in general the peers are good and gives you an environment where you can study well and some of the professors teach well as well yeah,0
sp_23-09,And I think the education hall is pretty good,0
sp_23-09,but there are a lot of good people here and a lot of good friends I met,0
sp_23-09,And even I don't want to do that because UST life is pretty good and it's not the best university life you can think of,0
sp_23-09,I saw many my friend actually Korean friends go back to Korea for different Korean university,0
sp_23-09,I think I adapted pretty well to my college life,0
sp_23-08,And a lot of calculation yes,0
sp_23-07,So I get out of variety of applications,0
sp_23-07,But mainly my interest is on Deep Learning,0
sp_23-07,I already got an offer so I will be working I am not sure about the topic yet but mainly I would like to look and work on natural language processing or even computer vision because they are both interesting fields,0
sp_23-07,So as you may know I am my plan is to work for I mean my plan is to do master under Pascale Fung,0
sp_23-06,So that was interesting,0
sp_23-06,Because we suppose to implement from stratch from neural network that can recognize cat and dogs,0
sp_23-06,Alright so I am taking those 6 courses and I think they are all fine manageably not so hard but computer vision is quite difficult because it's a master level course,0
sp_23-06,Oh operating system,0
sp_23-06,And what else  I am taking computer vision and  that is already 5 and I think there is one more but I can't really think of it right now,0
sp_23-06,So I am taking French international relation in East Asia and this course building intelligent interactive and intelligent system natural language processing,0
sp_23-06,I am taking 6 courses here,0
sp_23-05,It is just grilling on the pan or on the grill,0
sp_23-05,I think the most famous one in the restaurant is korean barbeque,0
sp_23-05,So other than korean barbeque there are stuff like cold noodles or let see I can only think one on my mind,0
sp_23-05,And there is a lot of food that you might not know that I can take you around if you would need to come,0
sp_23-05,It's obvious,0
sp_23-05,And about the food I recommend in Korea especially I would say Korean barbeque,0
sp_23-05,So I like to cook I like to learn how to cook I see recipes online,0
sp_23-05,Survival it's essential to survival when everything is so expensive especially in Switzerland,0
sp_23-05,I have learned how to cook during my life in Europe,0
sp_23-04,And it's fun because exercise exercise makes you also blow after the steam of the week,0
sp_23-04,I was in basketball team for Korean Society,0
sp_23-04,So I am in the basketball team,0
sp_23-04,I played during my weekends and with my fellow Korean,0
sp_23-04,For I also learned playing basketball for physical leisure,0
sp_23-04,And those aspects are really good as well,0
sp_23-04,That make you think about what you want to do about live,0
sp_23-04,But I also like actually some of them are really artisticly master pieces,0
sp_23-04,I like that part part about movie and TVs,0
sp_23-04,Those are really you know let you let me blow my mind of steam,0
sp_23-04,Sometimes I want to see just killing time movies like action movies hollywood hollywood block buster,0
sp_23-04,But what I see from what I want to see from each of them are quite different actually,0
sp_23-04,I like to watch TV series and movies mostly,0
sp_23-03,But I like it,0
sp_23-03,People say it's like the best place to live not the best place to hangout,0
sp_23-03,One I like about my hometown is that is quiet it's like living in Europe actually,0
sp_23-03,So a lot researches develop around that's cool and clean and firm,0
sp_23-03,So the best and biggest school like Korea in MIT it's it's MIT in Korea is called KAIST and it is in Seoul I mean is in Daejeon,0
sp_23-03,The best not the best actually the characteristic is being  the center of research and development of science and technology,0
sp_23-03,Then the air is very clean because of that,0
sp_23-03,It is not mean to tourist,0
sp_23-03,That's good,0
sp_23-03,What special about it That it's nothing touristic there first of all,0
sp_23-03,But if you take train is called KTX is about 1 hour 40 minutes actually,0
sp_23-03,It's 2 hours from Seoul by car so it's not that far,0
sp_23-03,My hometown in Korea is called Daejeon,0
sp_23-02,Nothing when I travel actually everyday when I go to new place for new good restaurant and neighbourhood,0
sp_23-02,So whenever I travel around the first thing I do is look for which restaurants are best,0
sp_23-02,I had good food there and the biggest reason I travel I like travel is actually food,0
sp_23-02,That was the most recent trip I have been to and the what I like about it was the food,0
sp_23-02,So I have been to Jeju Island at February,0
sp_23-01,And then what the uncle want was normal life normal education normal school with normal kids to learn social skills because her mother suicided because her worse social skills she has poor taste of men that led to the unwanted child and suicide,0
sp_23-01,So the main theme of this was that is it better for gifted child to have a normal life or actually have gifted education special education,0
sp_23-01,So her uncle was not mediocre she he her uncle the kid's uncle was also a professor in philosophy but and math,0
sp_23-01,It was about gifted child in mathematics and her mom was also gifted but she actually suicided before passing her child down to her uncle,0
sp_23-01,It was a really good movie I didn't really expect it would be good,0
sp_23-01,Okay I think the most recent movie I watch was called gifted,0
sp_20-12,The the most pressing things are generally just managing resources,0
sp_20-10,And i was more attuned towards the international students rather than the local ones,0
sp_20-10,Even though I went to an international school,0
sp_20-10,And it's really strange because I've always regarded myself as a person from Hong Kong,0
sp_20-10,Most of my friends are international,0
sp_20-10,So I only have a couple of local friends,0
sp_20-10,So in my second year I made a lot of friends,0
sp_20-10,But after I got to know them for a year in my second year after I joined the robotics team from my first year I got to know people really well,0
sp_20-10,So when I went in I was taking year two courses and everyone knew each other,0
sp_20-10,Mainly because I I kind of skipped a year,0
sp_20-10,Most of my friends now I made in my second year of school,0
sp_20-10,I made a like only a couple of friends in my first year,0
sp_20-10,So actually I'm not a the type of like really social person,0
sp_20-09,But at the same time I can appreciate the the culture here and the work ethic that people have here,0
sp_20-09,Turns out that it doesn't actually change as fast as I thought it would,0
sp_20-09,And I thought it would be really exciting to adapt to that,0
sp_20-09,So I felt like it would change really fast,0
sp_20-09,It also has a really young age,0
sp_20-09,So UST not only has entrepreneurship,0
sp_20-09,So I wanted to go to a college that was sort of free free spirited as well,0
sp_20-09,And i felt like I because I was sort of like a free spirit,0
sp_20-09,And UST was kind of like the obvious choice because it was either HKU or UST,0
sp_20-09,So really when I went into college I really had I didn't really have any doubts as to what I was going to do,0
sp_20-09,And I made that really quite a long time ago,0
sp_20-09,So computer science was naturally my like goto choice,0
sp_20-09,And so I could write programs do mathematics,0
sp_20-09,I was really more gifted towards mathematics,0
sp_20-09,So I wanted to continue that,0
sp_20-09,And that was really awesome,0
sp_20-09,So back in middle school I I played around with something called Lego Mindstorms,0
sp_20-09,So initially I I just chose my major because well the the story is a little bit long,0
sp_20-08,So yeah all the other courses that I'm taking are generally not very difficult,0
sp_20-08,The only exam that I'm worried about is actually just bayesian networks,0
sp_20-08,Three of the exams I'm not worried about because either I'm really sold with the material or it's open book,0
sp_20-08,I kind of skipped the lecture a few times and then just revise it at home,0
sp_20-08,I have a lot of courses but most of the courses are not particularly difficult,0
sp_20-08,So I have surprisingly few exams I only have about four,0
sp_20-07,And I will probably be doing an MPhil in some sort of database or networking related field and yeah,0
sp_20-07,But doing an MPhil is probably the the furthest I will go,0
sp_20-07,But I also plan on doing an MPhil,0
sp_20-07,And well I plan on doing it for a couple of years,0
sp_20-07,So the job is basically a software consultant sort of job for a cybersecurity firm,0
sp_20-07,I'm probably going to do that job,0
sp_20-07,So right now I already have a confirmed offer that I've already taken,0
sp_20-06,It's it's kind of interesting,0
sp_20-06,So I've been taking some independent studies projects some research projects building interactive intelligent systems what else natural language processing,0
sp_20-06,A lot of times people slack off in their senior year,0
sp_20-06,Mainly because I wanted to buck the trend,0
sp_20-06,So I'm taking quite a few courses,0
sp_20-05,I'm pretty proud of that actually,0
sp_20-05,Like I have cooked omelette in a rice cooker,0
sp_20-05,So like I can I can cook a lot of things that most people wouldn't think are possible in a rice cooker,0
sp_20-05,But I don't know how to cook either of these things but i'm really good at using a rice cooker,0
sp_20-05,Pizza is my second favorite food,0
sp_20-05,So sometimes I would also eat also eat pizza,0
sp_20-05,It's really hard to cook properly and it's really hard to find a place outside of Hong Kong that would provide that,0
sp_20-05,So my my favorite food of all time is goose intestines,0
sp_20-04,So either I I actually sketch something for a hobby or if I wanted to relieve stress I would draw on my coloring book,0
sp_20-04,So I thought like that that's usually what I do,0
sp_20-04,And it has a really calming effect,0
sp_20-04,So be it like coloring books then I would just fill the colors in,0
sp_20-04,Because it's calming,0
sp_20-04,So I like to draw mainly scenery,0
sp_20-03,I feel like I'm like an international citizen,0
sp_20-03,So although I like technically my hometown should be in Quebec I've always regarded Hong Kong as sort of some sort of superior hometown,0
sp_20-03,And there are too many people that spoke French,0
sp_20-03,The most the thing that I enjoyed the most in Quebec is corn beef,0
sp_20-03,But I haven't been there very much so I've only been back there a couple of times,0
sp_20-03,So I the topic of hometown is kind of complicated mainly because I was born in Quebec,0
sp_20-02,And I would really want to do something like that again,0
sp_20-02,And I thought that like California was just an awesome place and rather in Hong Kong I felt a little kind of restricted,0
sp_20-02,So really it was quite liberating,0
sp_20-02,And without restrictions for a long period of time,0
sp_20-02,Especially because I rarely had a chance to go out and experience like a true vacation without my parents,0
sp_20-02,And California gave me like a made me feel a lot more free than in Hong Kong,0
sp_20-02,I just played around a lot,0
sp_20-02,The my yeah so it was kind of not really a vacation because it was part of an exchange trip to Stanford,0
sp_20-02,So recently I went to California,0
sp_20-01,Because I really like philosophy and that sort of stuff really interests me,0
sp_20-01,Which I thought was really awesome,0
sp_20-01,And they they didn't provide answers but rather they provided different points of view that I hadn't thought of before,2
sp_20-01,And yeah I thought it was really amazing because it let me like think about sort of really deep questions that I've I've like lain in bed wondering about,0
sp_20-01,And the plot was really exciting because there were lots of developments that I didn't foresee,0
sp_20-01,It's mainly talking about futuristic android beings,0
sp_20-01,So I saw a TV show called Westworld recently,0
sp_19-12,So I feel very lucky that I got to do that,0
sp_19-12,And it wasn't because of because of somebody was pressuring somebody was pushing me to do it or pressuring me to do something,0
sp_19-12,So I got to try different things,0
sp_19-12,But I've always been able to select my own path and choose whatever I want to do in my life,0
sp_19-12,And in terms of not getting any pressure to do anything that anybody wants me to do,0
sp_19-12,So I think I've been very lucky with that,0
sp_19-10,So I've started putting in more effort into that,0
sp_19-10,But I have started to become friends with more local people now then before,0
sp_19-10,So it's mostly the international crowd that I that I'm close friends with,0
sp_19-10,So learned that and I wouldn't say like I know a lot of local students,0
sp_19-10,And because I've only been to I mean I've never outside India so I didn't really know what it was like to like know different people,0
sp_19-10,It took a while to get it get used to stuff,0
sp_19-10,So I think I could have handled the thing about getting to know people from different cultures different backgrounds a bit better,0
sp_19-09,So and yeah I mean that's why I came to Hong Kong and that's why I chose my major,0
sp_19-09,And Hong Kong is the financial center of like the China,0
sp_19-09,So which is also one of the reasons why I chose HKUST because it's in Hong Kong,0
sp_19-09,Instead of like what I just wanted to study which is economics,0
sp_19-09,Okay so I came to UST because I I thought I like could get exposure to different stuff,0
sp_19-08,And so kind of experienced in that,0
sp_19-07,And I'm pretty excited and looking forward to it but I wouldn't deny like going into further studies later on,0
sp_19-07,But I will be working as a software developer in a startup,0
sp_19-07,So I'm in my final year and after my graduation I won't be I don't plan to study for a bit,0
sp_19-06,Because there is not much to do in that course so I I actually I have done quite a bit before so there is no motivation to study for that course,0
sp_19-06,And that's pretty much the reason,0
sp_19-06,And the most challenging course would be time series because I don't really feel like studying for it,0
sp_19-06,And I find it really beautiful the way it works,0
sp_19-06,And it's pretty interesting what you can achieve with that,0
sp_19-06,So I find the most enjoyable I find is cloud computing because it's kind of the thing that I want to do,0
sp_19-06,So they are economics finance and computer science,0
sp_19-06,So I'm taking a variety of courses this semester,0
sp_19-05,So Indian food,0
sp_19-05,So in terms of percentage the number would obviously be high,0
sp_19-05,And India has like way way I mean like a lot of varieties,0
sp_19-05,But if I were to say the most number of dishes that I like from one particular cuisine would be Indian of course because I've been there a lot,0
sp_19-05,And I kind of have one dish that I like from every cuisine,0
sp_19-04,So that's my hobbies,0
sp_19-04,YouTube a lot and watch games and try to maybe follow a course or something from which I can learn something,0
sp_19-04,And try to learn new things I guess,0
sp_19-04,And apart from that I watch watch TV shows anime just like everybody else,0
sp_19-04,So putting it all together is a lot of fun,0
sp_19-04,And then it's just a good hobby because there's like a lot to learn from music,0
sp_19-04,Which takes most of my time apart from anything else,0
sp_19-04,So for leisure I play guitar and listen to music mostly,0
sp_19-03,You can find a variety of things in the same place which is quite rare,0
sp_19-03,And I like it quite a bit because of the food the people culture,0
sp_19-03,So in that sense I like Hong Kong a lot more,0
sp_19-03,So I'm from Delhi which is my hometown the capital of India,0
sp_19-02,And the food was pretty good,0
sp_19-02,Everything was like more open as compared to Hong Kong so it was a bit different,0
sp_19-02,So I had to travel a bit but it was all fun,0
sp_19-02,And his place was quite far away from the city,0
sp_19-02,So my last trip was to Taiwan when I went to visit my friend which just started living there,0
sp_19-01,So that's the kind of thing that I like to watch,0
sp_19-01,And throughout the show like you feel like a detective you're part of the thing,0
sp_19-01,And then in the end you find what's going on in the entire story,0
sp_19-01,And then through the answers arc like you follow one character's perspective through the story,0
sp_19-01,And then you they put you through a question arc which is like a series of questions that they that the mystery is trying to convey to you,0
sp_19-01,So it takes you through question arc,0
sp_19-01,So Higurashi is about it's a detective show kind of it's a horror detective show,0
sp_19-01,So so I've been I recently watched Higurashi which is an anime and if that counts,0
sp_18-12,So I never really had any pressure,0
sp_18-12,But they have always told that I always just had to be responsible in what I did,0
sp_18-12,They were never the type who would say I had to get good grades,0
sp_18-12,I'm very fortunate that my parents never really pushed me,0
sp_18-11,But people say in China the cost of living is lower,0
sp_18-10,And I'm not just like trapped within a small group so yeah,0
sp_18-10,But I think I get yeah I guess I was lucky I get to hang out with both students,0
sp_18-10,So there is not much of a language barrier,0
sp_18-10,But I guess I was lucky because I don't really have a defined group because I hang out with like local students and internationals because I speak English and Cantonese,0
sp_18-10,Well compared to high school I think I think people here definitely well at least in the engineering school definitely less sociable,0
sp_18-09,Choose to study in UST is a fine choice of words,0
sp_18-08,And also maybe look for a place to live in Shanghai,0
sp_18-08,Well most of the deadlines have been passed most of the deadlines have passed already,0
sp_18-07,So at least I got things figured out I guess,0
sp_18-07,So I'll just be like programming microcontrollers essentially,0
sp_18-07,And my job is an application engineer for a WiFi system on chip company,0
sp_18-07,I'm flying over to Shanghai on the first of June quite soon actually,0
sp_18-07,I already have an offer,0
sp_18-05,But if it's something easy like fried rice yeah definitely,0
sp_18-05,For I probably can't cook some of it myself so sushi I definitely can't make myself,0
sp_18-05,There's for each type of cuisine there's something that is good and there is always also something that is bad,0
sp_18-05,Well the food I like I wouldn't say there is a specific cuisine I like,0
sp_18-04,But now it's definitely just sleep and maybe going go outdoors once in a while,0
sp_18-04,And maybe back in high school would have been sports,0
sp_18-04,Definitely sleep maybe one or two years ago would have been League of Legends,0
sp_18-03,But I guess it's the same with every other city in the world,0
sp_18-03,So being from Hong Kong I guess I've always been home,0
sp_18-02,And it was really beautiful there like the scenery and the nature,0
sp_18-02,I went to New Zealand,0
sp_18-02,So the most recent foreign experience I had was when I went on exchange,0
sp_17-12,So that's my current pressure condition,0
sp_17-12,But I think appropriate amount of pressure is good for your life,0
sp_17-12,I comparing with them of course they may be better than me in some aspect but I'm also better than them in other aspects,0
sp_17-12,That's the reason I how I handle the stress,0
sp_17-12,And some of my friends they got offers from investment banking like JP Morgan or of course that cause peer pressure,0
sp_17-12,Most of them they are above four or something like that all Chinese students they can have meals with the president,0
sp_17-12,Actually they have a better academic performance than me,0
sp_17-12,And I just need to solve the problems and both physically and mentally for myself,0
sp_17-12,They respect my choices and they fully support it,0
sp_17-12,So the pressure is not from them,0
sp_17-12,For my parents I think it's okay because my friends because my parents their parenting style is like you can make all the choices in your daily life,0
sp_17-11,Actually most work is done and I only need to wait for the result,0
sp_17-10,That's actually that's something I don't like but I think I'm good at it,0
sp_17-10,And they you need to have a lot of thinking when it comes to understand the motivations of what the mainland people are thinking,0
sp_17-10,Because the Chinese people tend to think a lot in a relationship and they are trying to hide their feelings and they are trying to make other people feels good,0
sp_17-10,But for myself I think being friends with local international students actually is easier and more relaxed for me,0
sp_17-10,That's how we became friends,0
sp_17-10,And he at that time I play tennis with my friend and he asked if he can join,0
sp_17-10,I met him at tennis court,0
sp_17-10,Actually I remember the first my first international friend is from Korea,0
sp_17-10,And also the case also is suitable for international students,0
sp_17-10,But also I have some very good local friends because we are doing some project together and we have fun that we share some common interests,0
sp_17-10,So it's kind of obvious,0
sp_17-10,And ten percent of mainland students they come from all of the all of the mainland China,0
sp_17-10,And they all come from Hong Kong,0
sp_17-10,After all the local students eighty percent of the university is local student for undergraduate,0
sp_17-10,It's the percentage,0
sp_17-10,And they are very good at academic performing and they're really excellent students,0
sp_17-10,And also part of the reason is that the mainland students come here is like from the top of students in each province or cities,0
sp_17-10,And in the daily life the in the daily life the habits or the thinking patterns are similar among mainland students,0
sp_17-10,That's why the first bunch of friends that I met in UST that's where it's come from so,0
sp_17-10,And we have like about two weeks orientation,0
sp_17-10,And they arrange us an orientation thing and the we for the all the freshmen in mainland freshman in UST they organize us into ten different groups,0
sp_17-10,But because that the first thing is when we came to UST we have a mainland student scholar societies,0
sp_17-10,I will not have some kind of discrimations against them,0
sp_17-10,I treat mainland students I treat local students I treat international students equally,0
sp_17-09,I thought I would prefer I choose a major that I can I have the opportunity to change into other areas have the potential to do that,0
sp_17-09,So it's kind of the people that that the society needs right now,0
sp_17-09,It's basically like if you choose a major as math major or computer science major you if you work hard for yourself it's kind of it's like you are certainly can be employed and have a future,0
sp_17-09,The second one is computer science,0
sp_17-09,The first one is mathematics,0
sp_17-09,And the reason why I choose my major is I think in my point of view as well as many of my friends and some professor I met it's like there are two majors that is the most general majors in nowadays,0
sp_17-09,And UST is top university in Hong Kong so I think that's okay,0
sp_17-09,But if you come to Hong Kong like Hong Kong university or HKUST you only need to take the gao kao and the if you have enough points you can come here to take an interview,0
sp_17-09,And you need to have extra time to prepare for it,0
sp_17-09,The university entrance exam is if you want to go to United States you need to take SAT and you need to take TOEFL,0
sp_17-09,And another reason I choose Hong Kong instead of other countries like United States or Europe is the gao kao system in mainland China,0
sp_17-09,And for myself because I grew up at university and I kind of know how the system works I don't like that kind of academic atmosphere so I choose to come here,0
sp_17-09,And they know exactly how the high level education in mainland works,0
sp_17-09,And the reason why I choose UST is that like I said before my parents are professors in mainland universities,0
sp_17-09,And things works well for now,0
sp_17-09,So actually it works out not very well and after that I gained to realise it and I talked to my friends talked to my advisors and helped me to learn how to do that,0
sp_17-09,I think that's the only challenge that I faced when I come to UST,0
sp_17-09,Actually I think when I came to UST the most thing I need to adapt to is you need to manage your time very well,0
sp_17-08,And so the workload for the final exam is not as much as the previous one that I used to have like six or seven finals in my year two and year three studies so yeah,0
sp_17-08,I only need to fulfill the twelve credits minimum requirement for the university,0
sp_17-08,And for the final exams because I only have like three final exams because it's final year and I have taken all the courses,0
sp_17-08,And the I need to coordinate with my group member because it's a group project and I need to coordinate their times and we get I think we get it done by the deadline,0
sp_17-08,But I think it's okay though time is is quite enough,0
sp_17-08,That's basically the all of it,0
sp_17-08,And also I got project to report deadline at this Friday,0
sp_17-08,For now is the is exam period is coming and study break is ending and the the most concern is the final exams of course,0
sp_17-07,And right now I just do my things and see what is goes,0
sp_17-07,So that's basically my plan for now,0
sp_17-07,I want a more stable job for my future life,0
sp_17-07,So that's the reason I want to pursue a higher degree,0
sp_17-07,But this kind of work it's basically depends on the general situation of the market,0
sp_17-07,Actual reason is that if I work now as an undergraduate student maybe I'm lucky or I'm good enough I can get good salaries,0
sp_17-07,And or maybe be a research assistant,0
sp_17-07,So actually I'm working on some project with professor and to see whether it turns out if it works out then maybe I'd be able to continue my MPhil study with her,0
sp_17-07,For my case I already have job offers at analyst in an insurance company,0
sp_17-06,So it's just to broaden my knowledge,0
sp_17-06,So that's the reason why I take courses from these aspects,0
sp_17-06,And if you want to apply mathematics in financial areas you need to have a basic understanding of how the business works,0
sp_17-06,It's more like the for mathematics you require computer science to to do that,0
sp_17-06,If you are major in one subject you complete all the courses about that area learn a lot of stuff about that and then you can perform well in the future careers,0
sp_17-06,The reason I do that is that it's nowadays it's not like you know old times like our parents' time,0
sp_17-06,So I basically I take many kinds of courses,0
sp_17-06,And I minor in business but I'm also very interested in computer science,0
sp_17-06,Major in statistic and financial mathematics,0
sp_17-06,Oh I am a math major student,0
sp_17-06,For courses I have taken since I am final year student and I have already finished my major requirement like last semester,0
sp_17-05,And I treat cooking as a kind of art instead of just food itself,0
sp_17-05,It's really fun yeah,0
sp_17-05,And I think that if you like food cooking food for yourself is and for others is a very interesting thing because you can make some adjustments to what you like and just cook it,0
sp_17-05,And I got first place for one time and second place for two times so yeah,0
sp_17-05,I even have take take part in some cooking competition in UST is held by Chinese food society,0
sp_17-05,And for myself I love cooking for myself,0
sp_17-05,So I so it has a variety of different ways of cooking it as well as the materials that you use for it,0
sp_17-05,And the second reason is that the traditional Chinese food has a large variety of different types mostly based on different regions,0
sp_17-05,And it's very natural to like it,0
sp_17-05,One reason is that I born in mainland China and of course I have taste this is my habit of taste,0
sp_17-05,I like to try new food from everywhere in the world but I like traditional Chinese food the best,0
sp_17-05,For food I have various interests of food,0
sp_17-04,So it's something I really like to do,0
sp_17-04,And you can talk to them while playing and after that,0
sp_17-04,And the I think tennis is my favorite because it's it's a sports that you can relax yourself you can let your stress out by hitting the ball and you can also have fun with your friends,0
sp_17-04,Such as tennis or playing computer games or go out with my friends to watch some movies or have some delicious food,0
sp_17-04,In my leisure time I have many hobbies,0
sp_17-03,So both cities have different characteristics and I like them both,0
sp_17-03,It's almost like twice what you have to pay in order to live,0
sp_17-03,But the the cost of living is really high in Hong Kong comparing to Wuhan,0
sp_17-03,Although compared to Wuhan Hong Kong has a relatively good environment situation,0
sp_17-03,And so because of the business model and the so the atmosphere of the city is quite different,0
sp_17-03,But in Wuhan it also includes some construction business,0
sp_17-03,The first thing is that in Hong Kong it's it's a more the most business in Hong Kong is services or financial or something like that,0
sp_17-03,And compared to Hong Kong actually it's a very two cities that are different in many aspects,0
sp_17-03,And it has a lot of place of interest as well as many delicious food which I like the most,0
sp_17-03,And Wuhan is very famous it's a very old city actually but it used to call Wuchan in history,0
sp_17-03,It's a rather big city,0
sp_17-03,My hometown is Wuhan it's in the central part of China,0
sp_17-02,And well it's a good time,0
sp_17-02,And we enjoyed the local customs of theirs,0
sp_17-02,And we also went to Osaka which is at the central part of Japan and we enjoyed good food,0
sp_17-02,We the the reason we went there is because I we heard that the snow view there is very beautiful and we can have some hot tubs or something like that,0
sp_17-02,And we went we went to a lot of places in the north part of Japan,0
sp_17-02,Okay in last December I went to Japan for vacation,0
sp_17-01,That's the reason why I like it,0
sp_17-01,And also some moral questions on surveillance government control or something like that,0
sp_17-01,And I think it's quite educational and it's also in the big picture it's it it's it inspires us to think about the future of artificial intelligence and what impact it may have on us,0
sp_17-01,And it's not only a crime movie or an artificial intelligence movie it also talks about many aspects about what problems we may encounter in our daily lives and the potential danger that that we see in some scenarios,0
sp_17-01,It's mainly talk about a very rich billionaire who is also computer scientist has views on artificial intelligence which is able to recognize the potential crime behavior,0
sp_17-01,The I recently have watched TV series called Person of Interest,0
sp_16-12,You have your extracurricullar activities,0
sp_16-11,Other issues have been regarding academics,0
sp_16-11,And yeah I guess I guess that's like the issue that's been in my mind the most,0
sp_16-11,And all my all my other friends have like all the friends I know have gotten jobs at like banks and you know companies that pay well,0
sp_16-10,And well I'm trying to this summer I plan on learning Cantonese,0
sp_16-10,And I feel like yeah definitely language is an issue in terms of what happens outside class but I feel like inside class I'm doing a pretty okay job at interacting with other people with people both locals and other internationals,0
sp_16-10,I don't I have opportunities to interact with the locals here and they seem pretty nice,0
sp_16-10,I feel like I get along with people here pretty well,0
sp_16-09,And I chose UST because of the rankings because of its rankings and like the sheer amount of possibilities this place has,0
sp_16-09,And I thought that this is what I like to do my whole life so which is why I chose computer science,0
sp_16-09,I started programming when I was like twelve,0
sp_16-09,And you know ever since I was young,0
sp_16-09,I believe I'm doing an okay job at adapting to life here at UST,0
sp_16-08,I believe I'm prepared but let's see what happens,0
sp_16-08,Work's going okay,0
sp_16-07,After talking to a couple of seniors here I believe that would be a good option,0
sp_16-05,That's like my goto dish,0
sp_16-05,And my favorite and my favorite choice would be the chicken curry in ABC,0
sp_16-04,With friends from back home and friends over here,0
sp_16-04,And I sometimes I play Overwatch which is a first person shooter,0
sp_16-04,For leisure I have been playing a bit of I haven't really had much time for leisure but when I do I usually like watch that TV show mentioned recently mentioned previously,0
sp_16-03,And the people are more civilized I would say,0
sp_16-03,The infrastructure is miles ahead of what I'm used to,0
sp_16-03,I like I like Delhi way more than I like my current hometown which is Gurugram,0
sp_16-03,Well I was born I was born and raised in Delhi and right now I live in this city called Gurugram which is like this smaller city right next to Delhi,0
sp_16-02,And that's about it,0
sp_16-02,We just spend time together,0
sp_16-02,Just to visit my I have an aunt who lives there so we went to like visit her,0
sp_16-01,And I basically used to watch that to blow off steam and yeah that's why,0
sp_16-01,And so it's pretty old and the thing I like about it is that they it's just a classic that's what I like about that's what I like about the show,0
sp_16-01,Like they are like genre is crime and drama and this this show has been going on since 97 and that's the year I was born,0
sp_16-01,I've just been catching up on some old Indian Indian TV shows,0
sp_16-01,I haven't seen any new television series lately,0
sp_16-01,I saw this show,0
sp_15-12,So yeah no not that much pressure from parents,0
sp_15-12,So yeah that so that is that,0
sp_15-12,So even like even like minute scale it is there,0
sp_15-12,So there are people who got into like Duke university and all and I am just like okay,0
sp_15-12,I guess like some of my friends are overachievers so there is that competitive pressure that's there,0
sp_15-11,So yeah it is majorly like time management for me,0
sp_15-11,I feel like whatever direction I take it should be okay it won't be that bad,0
sp_15-11,Parents are also they have like kind of adjusted but again like time and that is there,0
sp_15-11,And given the fact that like a lot of my friends are in UST it's okay,0
sp_15-10,So there are things that I also do like so yeah that is what it is,0
sp_15-10,So I did start learning Cantonese also and it helps but you still don't there are certain values of Hong Kong that I probably don't agree with like the capitalistic regime and everything,0
sp_15-10,It's more because of the Indian community that is here,0
sp_15-10,So I do feel integrated into the society but that is not because of the locals,0
sp_15-09,Also like I just thought it's a very it's more international than other two so yeah I think yeah more or less,0
sp_15-09,Yeah I gave up a lot of things for this place,0
sp_15-09,And computer science department is really good,0
sp_15-09,UST in particular because the engineering department is really good,0
sp_15-09,I had to choose between these three,0
sp_15-09,And UST in particular so like I had Hong Kong university Hong Kong U CUHK and HKUST,0
sp_15-09,So when so when like I had to choose a college it was an easy transition for me because like the entire family got moving together that's why,0
sp_15-09,Why I came to UST is because my father worked here in Hong Kong and my mother was with me in India,0
sp_15-09,So now the question is like how to adapt to the next phase,0
sp_15-09,So like my college life is almost over so I guess by now I am adapted to it,0
sp_15-08,But yeah so it will be okay I guess,0
sp_15-07,It's hard to figure out,0
sp_15-07,I should I think it should have been closed by now but then it's not,0
sp_15-07,So it is open ended right now,0
sp_15-07,And I was also looking to like seeing whether I am interested in research or not,0
sp_15-07,So I also am looking at certain startups,0
sp_15-07,So that is that is as a technology analyst in Deutsche Bank,0
sp_15-07,So I did an internship last summer and they called me back,0
sp_15-07,I found a job,0
sp_15-06,And most of the materials that we did we briefly touched on them,0
sp_15-06,Also the material that is being taught is very new to me because I did not do any artificial intelligence courses before this,0
sp_15-06,I find building interactive systems pretty pretty time consuming because it has a lot of components to it that need to be fulfilled,0
sp_15-06,And one is graphics yeah,0
sp_15-06,One is a social entrepreneurship course where we are helping a social enterprise,0
sp_15-06,One is like Java and lie detection building interactive systems,0
sp_15-06,So I am taking four courses right now,0
sp_15-05,So yeah I would recommend like go to India eat food,0
sp_15-05,Yeah that is something I would recommend everyone to try because like the ones that you find in restaurants here is not the actual thing because they don't do it that well,0
sp_15-05,So yeah Indian food like curries,0
sp_15-05,I can make some like Indian food which doesn't taste that good but the food that does taste really good I think you need like experts for that,0
sp_15-05,And I like Indian food,0
sp_15-05,I like a lot of cheesy stuff like stuff that has a lot of cheese,0
sp_15-04,So that always just happens,0
sp_15-04,I would prefer to like learn Cantonese or something that would actually help me in life but yeah,0
sp_15-04,I would like to do a lot of productive things in my free time but I end up just watching TV shows or comedy videos Stephen Colbert or stuff like that,0
sp_15-03,I prefer Hong Kong for its flexibility and the commute it is easier,0
sp_15-03,And I enjoy it,0
sp_15-03,Whether I prefer Hong Kong or Jaipur I prefer Jaipur in terms of food because it is very suited to my palette,0
sp_15-03,So everyone knows about it whenever I talk about it,0
sp_15-03,So a lot of tourists who go to India go to Jaipur,0
sp_15-03,It's special in the sense that it's a very touristy place,0
sp_15-03,But it is pretty developed for a desert area,0
sp_15-03,Whenever like I tell anyone that it's a desert area people ask me questions like do you go to school on a camel are there trains in the city so yeah,0
sp_15-03,It's a desert area,0
sp_15-03,So I'm from Jaipur which is the northwestern part of Rajasthan,0
sp_15-02,So yeah that was fun,0
sp_15-02,Nice people pay like happy vibe it seems like people are always chilling,0
sp_15-02,It's really green and really beautiful,0
sp_15-02,And I really liked that place because because it is considered Europe's green capital and it really is,0
sp_15-02,So I went to Slovenia for three days when I was on exchange,0
sp_15-01,Something that I watched recently what did I watch I really have just been working sadly,0
sp_15-01,I wanted to watch a lot of stuff but I haven't been getting the time so yeah I have a big list of things to watch once the assignments and list of things get over,0
sp_14-12,Yeah otherwise people are quite supportive I guess,0
sp_14-12,My mum kind of wants me to graduate in three years because yeah family standards I guess,0
sp_14-12,Let's see,0
sp_14-11,But hopefully it does happen,0
sp_14-11,I could use more hookups right now that would be nice,0
sp_14-09,Well I still find it interesting like better than other majors I guess,0
sp_14-09,And also it's a good school I guess,0
sp_14-09,So that was the main motivation,0
sp_14-09,I well I am in UST because I save around two million Hong Kong dollars by going here,0
sp_14-09,Let's see,0
sp_14-08,I submitted it like a few seconds before it was due so thank God for that,0
sp_14-07,I mean I already have citizenship which makes it a bit easier,0
sp_14-06,They are more chill,0
sp_14-05,That's about it,0
sp_14-05,And if I had a proper grill I could make steaks yeah,0
sp_14-05,Does that count I can also make a decent pasta,0
sp_14-05,I know how to make scrambled eggs,0
sp_14-05,Some food that I know how to make,0
sp_14-04,I like to watch TV I guess binge watch TV,0
sp_14-03,I would say for as like a young person I would still prefer Hong Kong for now because there is still a lot of people around here like a lot of young people and a lot of fun stuff to do,0
sp_14-02,It's a good change,0
sp_14-02,Like it was much better compared to campus,0
sp_14-02,My latest holiday was well I just went back to the States for the summer and it was great cause I had good food,0
sp_14-01,And TV shows I finished binge watching Better Call Saul and BoJack Horseman and half of Suits,0
sp_14-01,I watched the first John Wick,0
sp_14-01,Let's see good movies,0
sp_03-12,There is no pressure as in my parents aren't tiger parents where always telling me you must study,0
sp_03-11,That's about them,0
sp_03-11,Yeah,0
sp_03-11,Jobs I am concerned but I am confident with my skills that will land somewhere,0
sp_03-10b,But if I would to say overall how the integration is I think sometimes I feel Hong Kong should open up more to international people not be so reticent,0
sp_03-10b,So like in my Hall for example I have some friends to whom I talk and they are local,0
sp_03-10b,If you talk to them they are very open and it's nice,0
sp_03-10a,So if I say in comparison what I find is that in Hong Kong people are more aphatetic to how you are doing there's less concern on your personal details that is fresh breath or fresh air,0
sp_03-10a,People are more mature right now and they accept differences more easily,0
sp_03-10a,I prefer this to secondary school because everybody knows how secondary school is,0
sp_03-10a,Secondary school was in India,0
sp_03-09,So it's a mixture of English and math and that appeals to me,0
sp_03-09,I like English,0
sp_03-09,Plus computer I like math and computer scientist most like math is also like English in the way that everything is the language at the end of the day,0
sp_03-09,One was employability right after a college,0
sp_03-09,And I chose computer science for a lot of reasons again,0
sp_03-09,I wanted that one year so I came to HKUST it has very good ranking in that time I think it still does,0
sp_03-09,And most of them choose to do it because doing something lower in that university implies you to not get higher one,0
sp_03-09,So only people who are at the top get computer science,0
sp_03-09,If you want to do computer science you must be the first batch of the rank,0
sp_03-09,So tt does not matter whether you want to study it or now,0
sp_03-09,Second I want to do computer science and the way major selection in India is how you perform in the entrance exam,0
sp_03-09,One I want to get out from India,0
sp_03-09,And I came to HKUST because of multitude of reasons,0
sp_03-09,I would adapt to university life after 4 years of studying here,0
sp_03-08,For president cup is on 10 May and 12 May,0
sp_03-07,And let's see what happens,0
sp_03-06,What else,0
sp_03-06,I know I can pass it,0
sp_03-06,And the course that ELEC is probably the simplest course that ever done,0
sp_03-06,It's coding it's not final exam,0
sp_03-06,I am not scared about the Computer because it's a group project,0
sp_03-05,But if you are asking Indian I prefer Northern over Southern Indian cuisine,0
sp_03-05,Like the Yunan noodles and all of that,0
sp_03-05,I mean if you are asking Chinese I like Sizhuanese because of the spice,0
sp_03-05,There is no particular food I like,0
sp_03-05,The one that make an experimental and probably I am the one who ends up eating them,0
sp_03-04,And you are trying to better any other's work and sometimes you are not satisfied with what you see like song lyrics see and write your own,0
sp_03-04,It all stands from well doing it since childhood and also stands from an escape from reality,0
sp_03-04,So I debate I sing,0
sp_03-04,So I would say writing is one of the best mediums also performances performing arts,0
sp_03-04,Even the innovative job you are looking especially in Fintech don't really let you do anything creative you can channel your creativity in writing,0
sp_03-04,To be very honest no subject allows you to step out in its rigid boundaries sort of say,0
sp_03-04,Because if I am looking for something creative in real life,0
sp_03-04,I do that because it is like an escape from real world and it is also applying creativity,0
sp_03-04,I think and that is basically literature activity,0
sp_03-04,Sometimes I rewrite song lyrics,0
sp_03-04,I have a blog,0
sp_03-04,I write poetry,0
sp_03-03,But I recommend both places for different experiences,0
sp_03-03,So I think as far own history is concerned the amount of tourists can do in Hong Kong is less than in Delhi,0
sp_03-03,It does not have a lot of places to visit and do stuffs that way as much as developing nations would have,0
sp_03-03,Visit some museums look at the big Buddha,0
sp_03-03,And also Hong Kong does not have a lot of things to do like you can it's all about you can go cycling or you can I don't know,0
sp_03-03,It's super organized sometimes it lacks a human feel that I feel Delhi does not,0
sp_03-03,It's probably it's a country means developed country and all that but otherwise I feel like the roads are clean God,0
sp_03-03,I see one thing about Hong Kong which I honestly feel it is very clinical,0
sp_03-03,Whereas Delhi is a huge hot pot and not exactly very safe but it is exist I am glad about that,0
sp_03-03,Hong Kong's metro system manages internationally known for its clarity,0
sp_03-03,While both Delhi and Hong Kong have a metro system,0
sp_03-03,So Hong Kong is obviously more organized saved for,0
sp_03-03,It's like comparing apples and oranges to be honest,0
sp_03-03,Do I prefer it to Hong Kong,0
sp_03-03,And what else,0
sp_03-03,That is actually from Delhi government sort to say,0
sp_03-03,And to take a local guide who can help them identify places are shady and not and not to travel after 9 o'clock at night,0
sp_03-03,But if my friends are female I would also recommend them going in group or they try not to stay alone,0
sp_03-03,Initally I would recommend to my friends,0
sp_03-03,It's a good place to go to,0
sp_03-03,And you would also find a various new kind of places like Kingdom of Dreams where there is a light show or you will find Akshardham temple which though originated from other state because Delhi created for you,0
sp_03-03,And because it's a melting pot of a lot different cultures you will find different cuisines that you would not find elsewhere especially if you are tourist and find it difficult to adjust to other cities,0
sp_03-03,But it has its own shared of Mogul Arab monuments,0
sp_03-03,It does not have as many as monuments or forts or that than other places,0
sp_03-03,If I recommend one thing in Delhi is taking a tour and visiting all the monument,0
sp_03-03,So naturally it is a metropolitant and it is a melting pot of a lot of cultures all around,0
sp_03-03,And the  what specialist that is the capital,0
sp_03-03,And from South Delhi that supposed to be the New Delhi area,0
sp_03-03,Delhi in India,0
sp_03-02,It was nice to debate with them,0
sp_03-02,And it was a good experience that would be from all works of lives,0
sp_03-02,And we went to Sun Yat Sen University,0
sp_03-02,That was nice and the place that we went to was more like India than I would have imagine China to be because you know China looks similar to Hong Kong in my mind space,0
sp_03-02,And it was nice the food was different,0
sp_03-02,Okay the last time I went on holiday was  2014 January to Genei in India,0
sp_03-01,And religion being so rigid and concept of Heaven and Hell is so prominent in people's mind,0
sp_03-01,But  generally it's more theological debate about people can believe,0
sp_03-01,I mean it is entertaining and it is very horrifying which is kind of nice,0
sp_03-01,So it is more about considering of the Bible is actually true and I am only watching it to make my opinion on whether I am agree or not,0
sp_03-01,Currently the one that was going on is supernatural stuff,0
sp_03-01,I don't stick to one I was multiple,0
sp_02-12,Like  because I am in HKUST my friends were my classmates there most of them are very  capable and  very good at study,0
sp_02-11,I do have a several directions,0
sp_02-10,And actually for Mainland students most of us are still spend most of time with each other and,0
sp_02-10,But we still hangout from time to time together,0
sp_02-10,And I also have other friends that we might not meet everyday,0
sp_02-10,I usually to most closest friends here,0
sp_02-10,I do have many closed friends here,0
sp_02-10,Yeah,0
sp_02-09,So I chose to come to Hong Kong instead of a same level university in Mainland China,0
sp_02-09,I feel that  it's  it's a better place for me  to pursue education in oversea environment in the future,0
sp_02-09,And I chose to come to Hong Kong because  I actually like the  international or the global what is it  academic environment here,0
sp_02-08, It is not a big deal,0
sp_02-07,Yes I do have an offer now,0
sp_02-05,I do make food sometimes myself but basically chinese food because that is what my parents taught me,0
sp_02-05,And that's why I came to Hong Kong food from all over the world like Japanese food sushi and  korean barbeque chinese hotpot,0
sp_02-05,I like different kind of food,0
sp_02-04,I think I am pretty good at it and I feel relaxed when I played guitar and sang songs,0
sp_02-04,I usually play guitar for my leisure time and because I think  I have learned and practiced it for about 10 years,0
sp_02-03,And  actually I do prefer Hong Kong than my hometown because  obvious it is more fun here and much more convenience here than my hometown,0
sp_02-03,But although actually it's kind of similar to  what we have in Hong Kong here,0
sp_02-03,Yeah I will recommend the local food there there are very good,0
sp_02-03,So my hometown is Foshan in Guangdong province  province,0
sp_02-02,It's a great university and people lived here classmates are very nice and especially like the environment in the United States,0
sp_02-02,I am so I am in last year I have been to the US for my exchange and  and I went to Purdue University,0
sp_02-01,Okay sure I just watched the Big Bang Theory recently,0
sp_01-12,And  and you know we have to play with those friends and we have to add this under more or less with the same standard with them,0
sp_01-12,Yeah,0
sp_01-12,So and I my friends well  you know I play with Chinese students they all have extremely high GPA they so good about research and math actually gives me some pressure,0
sp_01-12,Doesn't like doesn't my parents not give me pressure but you now it's more like from myself,0
sp_01-12,But you know you come to Hong Kong and you will I will go to United States I spend a lot of money you right,0
sp_01-12,They are not giving me pressure,0
sp_01-12,From my parents my parents actually a very nice very nice yeah,0
sp_01-11,Yeah,0
sp_01-10,I really enjoyed my life here better,0
sp_01-10,That's it,0
sp_01-10,But here I just play with my best friends,0
sp_01-10,You know sometimes it become very annoying,0
sp_01-10,But you have no choice you have just have to be there and have to get along,0
sp_01-10,Because in China in secondary school we are in a class big class,0
sp_01-10,And I mean for for the person I made I really like here better than my secondary school,0
sp_01-10,But I am the kind of person that I can get along with some very closed friends and I don't care about the rest,0
sp_01-10,Okay I think I think I can get along with my friends here really well,0
sp_01-09b,Yeah,0
sp_01-09b,So I come here,0
sp_01-09b,I really enjoyed making those robots and all the stuffs really attract me,0
sp_01-09a,So and the next question is about about what,0
sp_01-09a,Actually I think I can adapt well in here I am kind of person wherever I am I just get very get adapted in my environment very quickly,0
sp_01-09a,okay,0
sp_01-09a,I adapt,0
sp_01-09a,So why I choose why I choose adapt I adapt,0
sp_01-09a,Yeah,0
sp_01-09a,So I can see how they live and how the course are in China university in university I mean in China,0
sp_01-09a,I mean I grew up in an university in China in top university in China,0
sp_01-09a,Actually college life in Hong Kong is very different from those in China,0
sp_01-09a,So my college life yeah,0
sp_01-08,So yeah,0
sp_01-08,So so it is actually not big problem I mean even if I don't do this homework I get pass,0
sp_01-08,I did pretty well in previous like mid terms or homeworks and almost very high marks,0
sp_01-08,And but actually is not that hard for me because I said I already got an offer and for all courses,0
sp_01-08,Yeah,0
sp_01-08,Actually it is a very good question,0
sp_01-07b,I will go there in the August,0
sp_01-07b,Yeah I already got an offer,0
sp_01-07a,yeah  so anything else,0
sp_01-07a,I am continuing to graduate school to pursue master degree at the Purdue University in United States,0
sp_01-06,Well this semester I think I am not taking a lot of courses because it is my final semester,0
sp_01-05,And yeah that's all I think,0
sp_01-05,That's my favorite food,0
sp_01-05,Yeah,0
sp_01-05,And in the end you put some spice or like sauce like chillies like cumin,0
sp_01-05,So so the way I do is like just first put the meat in the like some sauce sauce it and then just put them on the fire and make it,0
sp_01-05,So not the way in Hong Kong the way in Hong Kong is like a lot of sugar or honey on the meat,0
sp_01-05,My favorite food is barbeques is chinese ways of making barbeques I mean there is a lot of ways to make barbeque,0
sp_01-04,Sometimes yeah it is like that don't find a lot of good reason,0
sp_01-04,But I just like them,0
sp_01-04,It make me well I can't find a very good reason,0
sp_01-04,I just feel I like them,0
sp_01-04,Whatever you like,0
sp_01-04,I think well I think for leisure you just do something you like,0
sp_01-04,And others like I also like reading books I like reading novels fantasy novels just I like as it before I like watching fantasy TV series,0
sp_01-04,Well I like to like to playing some computer games probably some esport games like Dota and starcraft,0
sp_01-03,Yeah,0
sp_01-03,It is fantastic,0
sp_01-03,yeah the food is there,0
sp_01-03,One is Chengdu in Sichuan and the other one is just Xian my hometown,0
sp_01-03,And the food there also very good especially well we said that in China there is 2 capitals of foods,0
sp_01-03,You know like ancient capital has all the cultures of China the traditional cultures,0
sp_01-03,And so why I recommend my hometown probably because for its cultures,0
sp_01-03,Because living in hometown I can live with all my relatives all the people I know,0
sp_01-03,And actually I prefer my hometown more to Hong Kong,0
sp_01-03,It is the capital of China for thousand of years,0
sp_01-03,It is in China in Mainland China,0
sp_01-03,Have you heard this city,0
sp_01-03,My hometown is Xian,0
sp_01-02,So interesting,0
sp_01-02,Because like you You just play with all people in the cities everyone just playing with you,0
sp_01-02,It is very interesting very lifting because we stress for days,0
sp_01-02,And you get wet all the times,0
sp_01-02,We have water gun to shoot to anyone in the street,0
sp_01-02,And especially especially very interesting because everyone just play with water,0
sp_01-02,I went to Thailand in the spring holiday and it was there water festival,0
sp_01-01,Yeah,0
sp_01-01,That's make me feel relief more,0
sp_01-01,You want to watch something that is far from real lives,0
sp_01-01,And I mean I like those stuffs that is far from real lives,0
s01312_16k.wav,My parents just give me the regular pressure you know get good grades and get a good job afterwards but nothing that really stands out or nothing that's actually detrimen detrimental,0
s01311_16k.wav,I'm not really that anxious about anything in particular um nothing really stands out just like regular problems so it's nothing major,0
s01310_16k.wav,I'd say overall university so far has been better but at the end of high school I had really good friends as well so I think as far as friends go I've been pretty lucky and enjoying myself,0
s01309_16k.wav,um University life is pretty awesome um I came to u this university because of the scholarship and like it's cheaper than US universities and I chose my major because um I didn't know what else to do,0
s01305_16k.wav,um I'm not picky as long as it's vegeterian food uh pizza pasta indian food anything does,0
s01304_16k.wav,I surf the internet a lot um I stream a lot of TV shows and movies that's probably my main stress release and um sometimes I play sports,0
s01303_16k.wav,So there's no reason why anyone would would wana go there so I don't really recommend it um I prefer both they're very different but I prefer to live in Hong Kong,0
s01303_16k.wav,um My home town would be in India a place called Roorkee it's pretty darn small,0
s01302_16k.wav,uh Where do I plan to go um Europe I'm going to exchange for Europe again and this time hopefully I'll actually remember things because I went last time when I was really really young,0
s01302_16k.wav,I've been to ho um Europe and places in Asia like India and Thailand,0
s01301_16k.wav,um I have I saw greys anatomy just yesterday and house and big bang theory um I don't like one TV show in particular or a movie type in particular anything really does,0
s01210_16k.wav,So I love to get along with other people,0
s01210_16k.wav,ok I am a very open and positive person,0
s01209_16k.wav,So yes I have to choose it,0
s01209_16k.wav,And okay I choose this university like my major is business because of my father's work,0
s01209_16k.wav,I am adapting to this college life very well because the the campus is huge people very smart and you you find lot of things to do for all week long,0
s01205_16k.wav,With a few ingredients you can do something yea,0
s01205_16k.wav,I am you know not worried to try French food when I when I am abroad but yes I prefer mine because it is very simple like pasta pizza,0
s01205_16k.wav,But I also like french food,0
s01205_16k.wav,I obviously I love Italian food laughs because okay it is well known in all world to be like a very simple but very good food,0
s01204_16k.wav,So yes those are things I prefer to do in my leisure my free time,0
s01204_16k.wav,And I would dance since I was six so for ten year and then I I had to stop when I went to the university,0
s01204_16k.wav,um in my free time I used to ok play some sport like I love to swim and I rode the horse before but now I have I don't have time to do it because it takes me so much time,0
s01203_16k.wav,um I prefer yea I obviously prefer my place to Hong Kong because okay it's my heart there's my house there's all my friends and everything but I also like Hong Kong,0
s01203_16k.wav,uc and uc small Rowan uc and Romeo and Juliet uc but uc it is like a touristic place but it is quite good,0
s01203_16k.wav,uc and uc,0
s01203_16k.wav,So I can recommend you to see it because it's you can see many places like amphitheatre uc,0
s01203_16k.wav,I love my city because it is full of artistic places to see the Roman city,0
s01203_16k.wav,ok I come from Italy and my hometown is Verona Romeo and Juliet's city but I am studied in Milan,0
s01202_16k.wav,I like also the people very smart people and uh the culture the temple every cultural things to see Bangkok and it was,0
s01202_16k.wav,I like the food the Thai food,0
s01202_16k.wav,And then we went to the full moon party for a night and then we went to Bangkok,0
s01202_16k.wav,ok um I've been to Thailand this weekend and it was weird because with Pantoon we found a train,0
s01201_16k.wav,So yes I like it ah ah I love this movie and okay just curse is this movie and I love this type of films so,0
s01201_16k.wav,ok ah yes recently I saw um Shutter Island is like,0
s01112_16k.wav,And for my parents well I suppose I live in a whole different continent to them so even though there are still expectations from my parents I don't feel as much pressure from them as I would if I still lived in South Africa,0
s01112_16k.wav,And they're always they're always asking me so what seminars what talks what uh mentoring programs etc etc have you signed up for and so I do I do tend to feel a little bit of pressure from them,0
s01112_16k.wav,And so they're always asking me so how many exchange points have you  have you earned right now and they've just come into university for less than a month maybe,0
s01112_16k.wav,And they they're fresh men they just came to unversity and so they're all very eager and they're very passionate and they're very enthusiastic and very competitive,0
s01112_16k.wav,But I'm I'm meeting a lot of my fellow global business uh classmates right now,0
s01112_16k.wav,uh In regards of academics well actually in any walk of life,0
s01112_16k.wav,And so I don't really feel any pressure from my close friends,0
s01112_16k.wav,They they like chilling outside the cafe and and they don't go to many of their classes and they chill at the pier until until early hours of the morning,0
s01112_16k.wav,um I don't feel any pressure from my friends because my friends are all very chilled,0
s01110_16k.wav,uh How I get along with local students I suppose I get on better get along better with them than other internationals because I was born here and because I can I can understand cantonese and because I speak mandarin,0
s01110_16k.wav,Because in high school uh your friends are all all come from very similar background and and so your interests are the same,0
s01110_16k.wav,Well compared to high school university socializing I suppose is a lot a lot better,0
s01109_16k.wav,So that's why my major right now is global business,0
s01109_16k.wav, And why I chose my major well again my parents thought that uh business and well especially the global business program is the best in the business field in in HKUST and in Hong Kong,0
s01109_16k.wav,So there's a lot of independence there's a lot of freedom and and that takes getting used to for a while,0
s01109_16k.wav,And so if I had stayed in university in South Africa it would have been a lot different to to right now because now I'm staying in university,0
s01109_16k.wav,But just  just hi bye friends ones that you say hi to and that and that you speak to for a little while,0
s01109_16k.wav,I suppose uh I'm adjusting well I'm I've I've made a lot of new friends and they're all very very nice,0
s01108_16k.wav,uh so And there's nothing else particularly difficult because what the work that I have right now are mostly presentations and that's what I prefer to uh other writing assignments etc,0
s01108_16k.wav,So uh so there aren't a lot of assignments right now and there aren't a lot of exams the midterms are still a month away around,0
s01108_16k.wav,And it's it's only sort a month into the first semester,0
s01108_16k.wav,And so the concepts are all pretty basic so there hasn't been a lot of uh need to review after classes,0
s01108_16k.wav,For example introductory uh accounting and introductory management,0
s01108_16k.wav,In uh my course since there hasn't been a lot of recent work or deadlines or assignments because my courses are mostly introductory,0
s01106_16k.wav,So the courses that I find more to be more difficult I think would be those that require a definite answer the more quantitative subjects,0
s01106_16k.wav,Because then the there isn't really a a definite right and wrong answer,0
s01106_16k.wav,What courses I think are the most difficult uh well I think what what courses I find easier than others are courses where it  where it requires more understanding I suppose and where the exams are not simply true or false or multiple choice where you can um where you can explain your reasoning,0
s01105_16k.wav,But I do know where to get it definitely in restaurants and in supermarkets,0
s01105_16k.wav,um And I suppose I prefer western food as opposed to chinese food having grown up in South Africa,0
s01105_16k.wav,um I I I like just one plate for me and one plate for for somebody else,0
s01105_16k.wav,Well I suppose um I prefer uh ordering for yourself instead of instead of what they do in China and what they do in a lot of places in Asia where they order for the table and everybody shares,0
s01105_16k.wav,But any recommendation I like,0
s01105_16k.wav,uh What kind of food do I like well I I I don't discriminate I love all  all types of food but just anything except spicy food,0
s01104_16k.wav, And also sports definitely um my parents were are big sports people and so from from when I was young I've played a lot of sports so that and also listening to music,0
s01104_16k.wav,uh What I like to do for lesiure Surfing the internet of course  you can't be at HKUST without uh learning so much more about the internet about what websites to go to about where to watch movies where to watch tv series,0
s01103_16k.wav,And when I'm in Hong Kong I think about home because my parents are in South Africa and  and you always miss going home on the weekend,0
s01103_16k.wav,And right now I prefer I prefer my home town because whenever  because you always want what you can't have and when I'm in South Africa I think about my friends in Hong Kong,0
s01103_16k.wav,Anywhere worth going well I'd say that Cape town is the  is the heart of tourism in South Africa,0
s01103_16k.wav,And and they recommend it to everybody else,0
s01103_16k.wav,uh anybody whose been to South Africa on  on holiday really really love it,0
s01103_16k.wav,uh What what I would recommend is is a holiday in South Africa definitely,0
s01103_16k.wav,Wine is the big export of South Africa as well as  we eat a lot of meat the the the stereotype about south african males is that they they barbeque a lot of meat although we don't call it barbeque we call it braai,0
s01103_16k.wav,Well I was born in Hong Kong technically but I think of Cape town South Africa as my home town and specialities in South Africa  that would definitely be um wine,0
s01102_16k.wav,So when  when I go there it feels more familiar then for example Hong Kong where everybody speaks cantonese,0
s01102_16k.wav,And what I like about China was that well it's  it's  it's there's a sense of familiarity because I  I speak chinese and a lot of my relatives are in China,0
s01102_16k.wav,What did I like about the place well Firstly South Africa is home so uh so  that in itself says a lot,0
s01102_16k.wav,also um,0
s01102_16k.wav,And after that I went back to South Africa where my parents are and  so I went home for the holidays,0
s01102_16k.wav,We we went all around China we went to Mongolia uh Xing Xiao uh Beijing uh lots of places,0
s01102_16k.wav,The previous holiday I travelled around China quite extensively,0
s01101_16k.wav,um My favourite type of movies or TV series preferably not the  the blockbuster action type but more uh with more drama and with more sentimentality,0
s01101_16k.wav,so um people people  are a little bit ashamed of  of loving gossip girl so much but I'm  I'm not ashamed of that at all,0
s01101_16k.wav,it's it's human nature,0
s01101_16k.wav,Because of well very little people like to admit it but it's a it's it's sort of a sinful pleasure because of all the drama and because people and people really indulge in uh seeing other people suffer in a way,0
s01101_16k.wav,The most recent TV series that  the most recent good TV series that I've watched has been uh definitely the new gossip girl the last season of gossip girl,0
s01010_16k.wav,And I think I have a lot of close friends uh since I came to Hong Kong,0
s01010_16k.wav, um I get along pretty well with local students because I speak Cantonese natively,0
s01010_16k.wav, um Compared to high school I think I prefer college life and the way people try to get along with each other here,0
s01009_16k.wav, And why I chose my major study the reason is I like economics and I like the logic to think in that field,0
s01009_16k.wav, and um the reason why I came to this university because it it's business school had very high reputation in Asia and Hong Kong is a very international and attractive city for me,0
s01009_16k.wav,I tried to adapt to the college life by staying around with my friends who are from Mainland and we help each other a lot,0
s01008_16k.wav,um And I don't have that much homework they are pretty simple,0
s01008_16k.wav,I haven't got any deadline to catch yet and um there's one course called uh derivative,0
s01008_16k.wav,uh The reason work has been going well for me,0
s01007_16k.wav,My plan right after graduation is go on a three month at least three month journey with my friends all around the world,0
s01005_16k.wav,I like spicy food especially chinese spicy food and I recommend sichuan specialities and I know there are a lot of Sichuan restaurants in my home town Shenzenum I don't know how to make it though,0
s01004_16k.wav,I like going on boat trips or sailing or wake boarding for leisure because I like the ocean,0
s01003_16k.wav,I'm from Shenzhen my home town is Shenzhen and it's specialty is spa and cheap fake goods and II really recommend Queens spa to go and I prefer Hong Kong over my home town because Hong Kong is more international,0
s01002_16k.wav,I've been to Thailand before for holiday and I like the food and the beaches there,0
s01001_16k.wav,Yes I have seen some good movies recently uh one them is about American History X uh my favourite type of movies are about dark humor,0
s00912_16k.wav,But with my parents because they do expect a lot from me and also because they want me to major in things like finance because they think it's practical,0
s00912_16k.wav,uh My friends don't really give me any pressure because I don't really compare myself with them,0
s00911_16k.wav,I believe in myself that I can do better uh this semester and on and on uh relationships and live life are they're acceptable they're not too worrisome,0
s00911_16k.wav,So I don't really tend to think about much think much about it and academic life because second semester was a lot better than first semester,0
s00911_16k.wav,I'm not really anxious about anything right now because for employment I still have another year of university to go,0
s00910_16k.wav,uh I think I get along with people quite well compared to highschool it's well I don't really compare them so I can't say which one's better uh I guess I can get along with local students,0
s00909_16k.wav,I decided to do uh do business because my dad thought it would be a better choice than studying politics or a social science,0
s00909_16k.wav,I came to UST because it was pretty close to where my family's staying and it the reputation is also quite good,0
s00909_16k.wav,um I really enjoy college life here because I have a really good set of friends,0
s00908_16k.wav,um I'll take I guess three years to graduate and uh wait I have a quiz coming up next month and no im fine,0
s00908_16k.wav,Work is going okay I guess I  I have some deadlines to catch for a few of my courses but they're not too soon and I'm not too stressed about it because I know I get the work done,0
s00907_16k.wav,And for further study my parents want me to go to law school so I guess I might be doing that as well but nothing really definite or concrete as of yet,0
s00905_16k.wav,So no uh in Hong Kong you can just go to some Korean shops or go to the restaurant but they're not really good here so i wouldn't really reccomend it,0
s00905_16k.wav,My favorite food is Korean food definitely and favorite from the Korean food would be kimchi,0
s00904_16k.wav,For my leisure time I like watching movies or TV shows or sometimes I also like to play the violin because it relaxes me and that's what I want for my lesiure time,0
s00903_16k.wav,And Hong Kong is not my home town because this is my second year living here,0
s00903_16k.wav,Because it's quite different from other asian countries um,0
s00903_16k.wav,um but I would say that I I would when I introduce myself to people I say that I am from Korea and for  uh Korea I would recommend people to try out the food and also the culture there,0
s00903_16k.wav,I grew up mostly in Korea but I've also lived in Canada and Shanghai so I don't really  have a home town,0
s00902_16k.wav,But then again I also like coming back home I don't want to stay on holiday forever,0
s00902_16k.wav,And I like going on holidays because it gives you a chance to just leave home and be somewhere new,0
s00902_16k.wav,I've been to quite a few places for holidays but mostly in Asia,0
s00901_16k.wav,Um I haven't seen any good movies recently but tv series I watch quite a few of them ah I only watch the ones that I like so I guess there are my favourite types of the ones I watch are my favourite types,0
s00810_16k.wav,I get along well with other people in university not mainly locals and mainlanders but definitely international people,0
s00809_16k.wav,So business is the safest option,0
s00809_16k.wav,And I study business because I've no idea what I want to do,0
s00809_16k.wav,And I came to this university because it's close to mainland China and I live there,0
s00809_16k.wav,I like my college life and I'm adapting pretty fast I'm a fast adapter,0
s00805_16k.wav,I like Indian food the most and I would recommend pani puri I do know how to make it and you can get it in any Indian restaurant,0
s00804_16k.wav,I like to go into the city and just walk randomly for leisure or I like to sleep because it's relaxing,0
s00803_16k.wav,um My home town is Mumbai and I like that it's really fast I recommend eating street foods there it's really good and it's worth going to shopping places and I prefer Mumbai because it's my home town,0
s00802_16k.wav,I've been to Philipines for holiday before and I liked the beaches there,0
s00801_16k.wav,The most recent tv show I watched is gossip girl and it's about four people young people fighting all the time and my favourite type of tv series is drama,0
s00710_16k.wav,um I integrate into Hong Kong society by go to places where only local students usu local people usually go and speaking their local language and also by taking one of the Hong Kong society courses,0
s00710_16k.wav,um I get along with local students by trying to speak their their language and joining their activities,0
s00710_16k.wav,I get along with other people by um respecting other peoples habits or um attitudes anand stuff like that,0
s00709_16k.wav,And I choose my major because I'm good at biochemistry and I think this is something that interest me,0
s00709_16k.wav,um The reason I choose this university is like because I like  I want to come to Hong Kong to see a different culture and different um studying envionment,0
s00709_16k.wav,um I adapt to my college life by making new friends with people around me,0
s00705_16k.wav,um I don't know how to make it because it's really complicated and but I can really buy I can buy it in the restaurants,0
s00705_16k.wav,um It's it's the kind of food that you have uh the soup that you have to make it for like two hours or so and I like it even the one in our university canteen,0
s00705_16k.wav,um The food I like most is ah  traditional cantonese soup,0
s00704_16k.wav,I like to go for running or swimming when  ever I'm free because its uh I like to do excersises  make me feel fit and energised and relaxed,0
s00703_16k.wav,um The place that's worth going is the east lake ah it's very it's a natural place very nice I prefer it I prefer my home town to hong kong because it's still my home town where I grew up yeah the all the people and places,0
s00703_16k.wav,My home town is wu han in mainland china I like um the food there is very special um it's nice um hot dry noodles it's very good,0
s00702_16k.wav,um I like the place because it has totally different ah culture background and it's very nice to see the beautiful views,0
s00702_16k.wav,I've been to Europe for holiday half a year ago um I've been to like Greece Italy and Spain,0
s00701_16k.wav,um I've seen a good movie called um the inception its its about the dream and scien scientifc stuff actually um this my favourite type of movie is about like love and romance,0
s00612_16k.wav,But I do have a few friends that is like very sparkling and try to like push me to do a lot of things,0
s00612_16k.wav,So they don't really give me any pressure my friends um most of them are fine they're like timid and shy,0
s00612_16k.wav,My parents are really open minded and like they don't really care what I'm doing as long as I like what I'm doing,0
s00610_16k.wav,But like we're fine um I prefer my home town than Hong Kong somehow because as I said more personal space and everything's larger but I do like Hong Kong,0

s02210_16k.wav,The juniors might not talk to seniors a lot,0
s02210_16k.wav,In the high school they had seniors and juniors,0
s02210_16k.wav,Compare to high school I think high school was different high school that was  ah ah segmentation I would say,0

s02203_16k.wav,I come from ah very small town in Bangladesh it's called Sylhet,0
s02202_16k.wav,so it's very relaxing,0
s02202_16k.wav,I've been to North Eastern Indian Region that has a lot of green and it's very fresh it's polution free,0
s02202_16k.wav,em But India the places that I've been too is very historical very beautiful,0
s02202_16k.wav,ah I plan to go to Malaysia soon,0
s02202_16k.wav,I've been to the North East of India Region,0
s02202_16k.wav,ah I've been to the Taj Mahal in India would is in Akra,0
s02202_16k.wav,I visited several places in India,0
s02202_16k.wav,I've been India before,0
s02201_16k.wav,It's about vampires and my favorite type of movies would definitely be horror type,0
s02201_16k.wav,ah It's called the Vampire's Dairies,0
s02201_16k.wav,yes I've seen a good TV series recently,0
s02112_16k.wav,So no pressure at all,0
s02112_16k.wav,I know that a lot of them they have a lot of pressure from home but I know my mom she can  she just says that if you don't like university you can come back any time you don't even have to finish graduation,0
s02112_16k.wav,um Actually my parents they dont give me any pressure at all which I think is pretty odd for most Asian people,0
s02111_16k.wav,Academic life not at all maybe ask me again one day before the midterm but right now not really,0
s02111_16k.wav,hmm What kind of things am I anxious about I'm not really anxious about employment yet because I have at least two more years of studying so of course sometimes I think about summer internships and stuff but I wouldn't really say I'm anxious about it,0
s02110_16k.wav,uh there are some students they are more international and of course it's easier because they have more things in common,0
s02110_16k.wav,uh I think I get along with other people okay most of the time and I'm pretty sure that it's getting better all the time because every time you meet someone new you learn more about it,0
s02110_16k.wav,uh How do I get along with other people well I guess you should be asking other people that question,0
s02109_16k.wav,And uh yeah I guess that's pretty much the reason,0
s02109_16k.wav,And I mean most people here actually very nice and it's not that hard to adapt well and why did I come to this university well I lived in Shanghai before so in Hong Kong they have very good universities,0
s02109_16k.wav,uh I think I'm adapting to college life pretty well because I've been a student for quite some time now,0
s02105_16k.wav,uh I would say that my two favorites cousines in the world would be maybe Italian and Thai food or yeah actually I like Indian food a lot as well,0
s02104_16k.wav,uh In my free time I'm mostly like going out getting drunk because life in UST kind of sucks most of the time so once in a while it is nice to have a cold one and just relax,0
s02103_16k.wav,uh I'm from a small town in Sweden called Valdemarsvik its only around five thousand people living there,0
s02102_16k.wav,If you want to go there I recommend it,0
s02102_16k.wav,We went to a place called Puerto Gelara its near Manila and its a  a really nice place actually,0
s02102_16k.wav,uh This summer I went to the Phillippines with a couple of friends,0
s02101_16k.wav,uh Its actually a really good its kind of violent so if you are sensitive I would not really recommend it but for anyone else i  if you want an enjoyable movie I think you should really watch it,0
s02101_16k.wav,Okay so I watched a movie called Machete,0
s02012_16k.wav,But it is also  I do not regard it as a pressure because you know I'm  I'm self motivated person so I I can manage my pressure pretty  pretty well I think,0
s02010_16k.wav,Um yeah I do have many close friends here not a lot but like really good friend like five or six,0
s02010_16k.wav,Yeah I can integrate into Hong Kong society because I know like I lived in China for seven years so  and I also speak Cantonese so I can understand their culture and everything better,0
s02010_16k.wav,I'm learning  I'm actually learning Cantonese from them,0
s02010_16k.wav,Um I  I do have some local friends and they are like including my old roommates and they are very kindly,0
s02009_16k.wav,That is how I chose my subject,0
s02009_16k.wav,Um And I chose um finance and OM because I like  I like these subject,0
s02009_16k.wav,Um And also I got scholarship as well so I decided to come here,0
s02009_16k.wav,Ah I have chosen to come to this university because um it is more cheaper than ah other schools in US or UK,0
s02009_16k.wav,I have made a lot of friends,0
s02009_16k.wav,Um I'm doing good in college,0
s02007_16k.wav,And I think I have no communication problem,0
s02005_16k.wav,Ah but I also like Thai food and ah I like the Tom Yum Soup in Thai food ah but I do not know how to make it,0
s02005_16k.wav,Um I'm Korean so I like Korean food the best  the most,0
s02004_16k.wav,Ah That's how I control  how  how I manage my stress level,0
s02004_16k.wav,Ah for my leisure I like to do sports like I like going gym or I like play  playing football or tennis,0
s02003_16k.wav,And I feel more comfortable there,0
s02003_16k.wav,And I prefer my hometown over Hong Kong because you know it is my country,0
s02003_16k.wav,Um you can also go to some old palaces to  to see traditional stuff about Korea,0
s02003_16k.wav,There many new Korean restaurants,0
s02003_16k.wav,Um I recommend ah you go to eat some Korean food in Seoul,0
s02003_16k.wav,Um my hometown is Seoul Korea,0
s02002_16k.wav,I like that place,0
s02002_16k.wav,And we went to this really small um island called Mantanani and it was really beautiful,0
s02002_16k.wav,Um for last holiday um I went to Malaysia Kota Kinabalu ah with a bunch of my friends,0
s02001_16k.wav,It's like a singing contest,0
s02001_16k.wav,it's like American idol,0
s02001_16k.wav,Ah recently I've seen this Korean ah TV show which is called super star K,0
s01910_16k.wav,I think I made friends for life compared to what I did in high school,0
s01910_16k.wav,uh I get along with people very well at college,0
s01909_16k.wav,But the social side is uh liberating,0
s01909_16k.wav,um It's more the academic side of it that's a little bit challenging,0
s01909_16k.wav,College life is uh easy to adapt to,0
s01905_16k.wav,I enjoy it a lot,0
s01905_16k.wav,Uh I have a restaurant in Hang Hau Tsuen where I usually go for Thai food,0
s01905_16k.wav,I like uh Thai food uh Thai cuisine is probably my favorite,0
s01904_16k.wav,See usually I do a lot of sports uh I hike uh trails to uh  to go to the beach Tai Long Wan uh to surf,0
s01904_16k.wav,For leisure I like uh surfing um I also like hiking Hong Kong is perfect for that,0
s01903_16k.wav,uh I can recommend going to see the Opera it's the biggest one in Europe,0
s01903_16k.wav,I like uh Oslo my home town,0
s01902_16k.wav,I have been on holiday to Beijing and I like Beijing a lot because it's a lot cheaper than Hong Kong,0
s01901_16k.wav,It's the first movie that talks about lucid dreaming,0
s01901_16k.wav,uh last week I saw the movie Inception which was a very good movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio which is uh about stealing other people's uh dreams and planting ideas,0
s01812_16k.wav,uh No my parents  my parents haven't give me any pressure,0
s01810_16k.wav,But the  local students are  I'm starting to get used to them and uh I'm starting to get along with them and uh I think uh I have somewhat integrated into Hong Kong society,0
s01809_16k.wav,The reason why I chose this university is because I know that UST is very good in its technological side,0
s01807_16k.wav,um PhD how long does it take to graduate I think it would take around two years,0
s01807_16k.wav,uh Have I got an offer Yes uh I have had an my offer and uh it  it is the one I wanted uh I wanted to go to U of T,0
s01807_16k.wav,But uh on other hand my professional knowledge and skills uh will compensate for that and also my communication skills will be a lot better,0
s01807_16k.wav,But I have been going to recruitment talks,0
s01805_16k.wav,uh I do know how to make it you just need dough and some ingredients,0
s01805_16k.wav,I like  I like pizza because uh you can basically put any kind of topping on it and it taste delicious,0
s01804_16k.wav,So when I'm passive it's uh it's a lot better,0
s01804_16k.wav,uh The reason being that when I watch TV I can be really passive and then because uh normally I'm doing a lot of work,0
s01804_16k.wav,uh For lesuire most of the time I just watch TV or I hang around with my girlfriend,0
s01803_16k.wav,And uh I'll definately recommend it because it's really tasty,0
s01803_16k.wav,uh The speciality I'd say was uh in South Africa is Biltong,0
s01803_16k.wav,Um my home town is uh South Africa uh um it's a little town called uh called N uh New Castle,0
s01802_16k.wav,And then when I'm in the US I  I pretty much like the food,0
s01802_16k.wav,But then when I'm in Asia I like the sun,0
s01802_16k.wav,The UK I just like the  the  the culture and also kind of like the rain,0
s01802_16k.wav,uh What did I like about th  those places,0
s01802_16k.wav,uh I've been to the UK I've been to uh the US I've also been to a couple of places in Asia,0
s01801_16k.wav,It's How I Met Your Mother it was about uh  it was about ted and me ah  him trying to meet his uh  his  his wife and tyring to get a girlfriend,0
s01801_16k.wav,uh Yes I have seen uh some TV series lately,0
s01711_16k.wav,uh But maybe uh when we are talking about relationship and love life that will probably come later,0
s01711_16k.wav,That's the most important thing,0
s01710_16k.wav,So uh I'm uh familar with uh  with how they think and nothing suprises me here in Hong Kong,0
s01710_16k.wav,I uh get along with the people here just fine uh even with local students because I actually have lived in Hong Kong for uh ssixteen years,0
s01709_16k.wav,In  In order to do that I uh had to start with studying uh electronics and uh HKUST is very well known for uh electronic engineering so that's why I chose this university,0
s01709_16k.wav,uh In order to fulfill my um dreams I always wanted to do uh biomedical research,0
s01707_16k.wav,Uh I'm not looking for a job I'm applying for uh  I'm sending applications for universities,0
s01707_16k.wav,uh So my plan after graduation is to actually start a PhD in US,0
s01705_16k.wav,uh I wwould recommend Tunisian food of course and no I do not know how to make it,0
s01705_16k.wav,Food that I like is anything which is not offered in UST,0
s01704_16k.wav,Um na what I like to do for leisure is um playing sports such as uh rugby football any sports that requires you to run,0
s01703_16k.wav,If you enjoy the beach then you will have a very good time there and uh yes I do actually prefer Hong Kong than my  my hometown because uh life is much more easier here in a  I like a country which offers a good service,0
s01703_16k.wav,uh My home town is uh Tunisia and the what I remin  recommend to um uh strangers is to see uh couple of cities uh such as uh Bizerte Monastir Hammamet and Nabeul,0
s01702_16k.wav,So lately I have been travelling to uh China and uh I did not like anything about it except the uh travel I did in uh Lijiang,0
s01701_16k.wav,My favorite movie is  actually I have many favorite movies uh so one of them is Lord of the Rings,0
s01701_16k.wav,What is good about is that um I like movie that surprised me and shock me,0
s01701_16k.wav,Yes I have seen uh a good movie uh um a week ago which is called um The Experiment,0
s01612_16k.wav,I  I cope,0
s01612_16k.wav,But uh I manage to cope with it,0
s01612_16k.wav,No my parents and friends do not give me any pressure because at the end of the day it's my life I make my own choices,0
s01610_16k.wav,So you can uh  you can share your experieces your food your cultures etc,0
s01610_16k.wav,Uh I think I get along pretty good with people here I mean compared to high school of course these guys are more mature but uh at the same time there is more diverse cultures here,0
s01609_16k.wav,I'm adapting pretty good to college life um friends are good here the environment is really good beautiful view and I in the end I chose marketing and finance as my major,0
s01608_16k.wav,And uh I hopefully the last year will not be as tough as it is going to be this year,0
s01608_16k.wav,How  how long will I take to graduate Well this course is  I'm doing BBA and I'm in year 2 so I have one more year to go,0
s01608_16k.wav,But uh when it comes to any difficult problems whatever I'll go straight to the professor be honest with her or what  what  what is hard and hopefully she can help me out,0
s01608_16k.wav,uh I  I don't find it that difficult because I like to self study in the library a lot so I get the material,0
s01608_16k.wav,So you know I'm starting to manage starting to get more advice from seniors,0
s01608_16k.wav,How is my recent work going well to be honest um year two work just started,0
s01605_16k.wav,Well because I  I can take spice and I love the flavor,0
s01605_16k.wav,But um when it comes to recommendations I would definitely recommend Indian food,0
s01605_16k.wav,Well talking about food I mean I used to eat healthy and stuff when I had the time and money but now I have no time because I'm always stuck in the library so I've been eating really unhealthy and getting fat,0
s01604_16k.wav,But right now it's in the library that's my leisure time I've been studying,0
s01604_16k.wav,But uh you know I also like um you know playing computer games hanging out with friends that's my leisure time,0

s01603_16k.wav,And of course I prefer Hong Kong my hometown because I was born here and raised here,0
s01603_16k.wav,Uh if  if you're asking me is there anywhere worth going I would say definitely Lang Kwai Fong to chill and you know remove your stress or whatever,0
s01602_16k.wav,Man I really  I really really liked that place the girls everything the food it was great but now I mean I guess I need to concentrate on my studies,0
