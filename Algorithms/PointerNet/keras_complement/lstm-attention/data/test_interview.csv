sp_25-12,My friends back home would be the same fewer and fewer unfortunately,1
sp_25-12,So I kind of got used to not being home talking with parents pretty rare or not that often,1
sp_25-11,But I still have to pass and do good job probably for myself I would do the best for myself and not for my grade,1
sp_25-11,So I don't feel pressure here so much,1
sp_25-11,And I got a good grade and would compensate with the grade here,1
sp_25-11,So my master degree was in the first semester,1
sp_25-11,And also I got my Master degree in the Southampton,1
sp_25-11,So I don't feel the same pressure as other people probably,1
sp_25-11,From the academic perspective I am not really worried because I do have job already,1
sp_25-11,This is 1 1 thing I worried about at the moment,1
sp_25-11,And I just hope I won't be really much affected by this by this change if it would happen,1
sp_25-11, So depending I mean I would have higher education in the UK and also the fulltime job but still you don't know how this is gonna end up,1
sp_25-11,I am really worried about right now is Brexit because it would affect me directly pretty soon,1
sp_25-11,So I think I am worried about,1
sp_25-08,In the UK we don't do open notes never,1
sp_25-08, So 3 hours each and in the same day,1
sp_25-08,So I only have 2 exams this semester,1
sp_25-07,So I prefer backend low level stuff which is happening in Bloomberg,1
sp_25-07,I cannot talk about this,1
sp_25-06,Challenging one,1
sp_25-06,So among all of my courses I found this the most like challenging one,1
sp_25-03,What I don't like is university and academic environment that is why I left to get higher education in another country,1
sp_24-12,But I think most of my pressure is internal and not external yeah,1
sp_24-12,Like if I came home with a C she would be like oh why didn't you like study harder you should you could have done better what did you do But other than that in general I don't think it's I have a lot of external pressure,1
sp_24-12,I think my mother puts a bit of pressure on me,1
sp_24-11,Because everything depends on how well other people do and I think that's terribly stressful,1
sp_24-11,And you don't know how much leeway you have,1
sp_24-11,Just to pass the class I need to get a C,1
sp_24-11,And even if in theory I don't really need to be studying that hard because they don't figure my transcript,1
sp_24-11,And so I've been really trying my best to study really hard,1
sp_24-11,I have to do an extra year just to take up those credits,1
sp_24-11,I can't start my masters,1
sp_24-11,But if I fail like more than two classes I have to actually retake a year,1
sp_24-11,And if I actually don't get my credits accepted then I either need to take that course during my masters if it's just like a small class,1
sp_24-11,So I need to be above average to make sure that I get all my credits accepted,1
sp_24-11,And I heard in some departments a C minus is basically what you get if you are just average,1
sp_24-11,But if I want to get my grades accepted then I have to at least get a C and not a C minus,1
sp_24-11,So right now my biggest anxiety is actually grades because so here you basically pass marginally with a D,1
sp_24-10,So we don't really get to see each other and they are in different majors so we don't have class together,1
sp_24-10,So honestly I don't have that many local friends,1
sp_24-09,But it wasn't my first choice to be honest,1
sp_24-09,And then purely based on your GPA you get assigned a school,1
sp_24-09,And I used to not really care because back home it only really mattered if you pass an exam or not,1
sp_24-08,But because the deadlines and everything is so spaced out and because I had an exam today honestly I don't really care too much about studying,1
sp_24-08,And then in a week I have another exam,1
sp_24-08,So I have today I had an exam and then I have the deadline for this class,1
sp_24-07,So that's what I'm a bit worried about but there's thank God no application process,1
sp_24-07,And it's hard to pass your classes,1
sp_24-07,But yeah the only thing with Switzerland and masters is that you need to pass your classes,1
sp_24-07,And before I do that I will have an internship,1
sp_24-07,I didn't need to write any applications or anything,1
sp_24-07,Because I'm because in Switzerland the system is like that that if you do a bachelors in your school you basically automatically get accepted into the masters studies,1
sp_24-07,So I'm going to start my masters this fall,1
sp_24-06,And now it's suddenly finals and you have to study for that,1
sp_24-06,Because every week we either had homework due or a lab due or there was a midterm,1
sp_24-06,And because we had homeworks and labs the it was actually kind of stressful to to do all of this,1
sp_24-06,And I need to do a lot of studying just to solve the homeworks,1
sp_24-06,Just because I tend to make a lot of mistakes,1
sp_24-06,And then I think electrical engineering was probably the hardest,1
sp_24-06,I stressed out a bit about math but after the midterm I realized that it was not as challenging as I assumed it to be,1
sp_24-06,And for me the hardest one I don't honestly I don't think there is a really hard class this semester,1
sp_24-06,I took Chinese level two I took an electrical engineering class then two computer science classes and one math class,1
sp_24-06,So this semester I took four courses,1
sp_24-05,Or like I wouldn't say plain a bit more clean,1
sp_24-04,But here I really can't do that,1
sp_24-04,But I can't cook in Hong Kong,1
sp_24-03,You can't sit in a cafe and just drink a coffee because there is no space,1
sp_24-03,It's not too crowded,1
sp_24-03,There's not too many people,1
sp_24-03,It's also very expensive but a bit less so,1
sp_24-03,Everything is closed on Sunday's it's a bit boring,1
sp_24-03,There's not that much to do,1
sp_24-03,It's very very expensive,1
sp_24-02,I actually didn't really want to go to China because I was a bit scared,1
sp_24-01,But it's not that,1
sp_23-12,Because Hong Kong is not the biggest port anymore,1
sp_23-12,There is no place there is no place to go especially in Hong Kong,1
sp_23-12,That's why that's why he said this field is going down and is not going up anymore,1
sp_23-12,So that's why I asked him what do you think about this field because I am thinking about these two and I don't know what to do right now,1
sp_23-11,I mean when you say luck it's not always about you can you can see that when you get a job it's not always about what you want it's about timing and everything whether they have job opening or not,1
sp_23-11,So what I worried about the most is that I will be lucky enough to secure good job,1
sp_23-11,It's all not been luck but I think been some luck in it,1
sp_23-11,And I really suffered I have been quite lucky enough actually to get into this Master MPHIL program and to this lab,1
sp_23-11,But future there is a lot of luck involved in future,1
sp_23-11,But that's nothing to worry about my grade because that's all about working hard,1
sp_23-11,At this stage at this moment the mostly I worried about my future my grade,1
sp_23-11,I think my family issues in relationship issues are not problem for me,1
sp_23-10,So if you say that I can't blend it to the community because I am not hanging out locals then yeah,1
sp_23-09,But I didn't have any thoughts about that,1
sp_23-08,And then I have 5 upcoming exams and 2 of them are this week at the weekend the rest are the following at the following week,1
sp_23-08,There's only 1 assignment left which is the final report for this project course,1
sp_23-08,So that was a bit stressful and it's all done now and I am happy,1
sp_23-08,We have to do reestimation part of it which actually it is really time consuming and a lot of manual labor,1
sp_23-08,It was we are supposed to do on prior knowledge what we learned from tutorials on Hidden Markov Models,1
sp_23-08,It was the final assignment,1
sp_23-08,Recent most of most recent one what I just finished is actually yesterday is for natural language processing,1
sp_23-08,That's been quite stressful actually because I have to stay stay up all night for a while only sleep for 4 hours a day to finish those assignments,1
sp_23-08,Every day I have a new deadline to match to meet,1
sp_23-08,So I have been living on deadlines for like a month right now,1
sp_23-06,But the project was interesting especially that course,1
sp_23-06,So it's quite difficult for that,1
sp_23-06,The lectures are not easy to follow because the professor always just writing down mathematical stuffs on the board without explaining much and then he expects us to read papers before the class,1
sp_23-05,And that's nothing to cook about them actually,1
sp_23-04,So I don't need to care about what is going out in the real world for while,1
sp_20-12,But in the future I might I might just kind of draw back to reality,1
sp_20-12,So right right now I'm still still kind of dreaming,1
sp_20-12,So those things are kind of in conflict with each other,1
sp_20-12,But at the same time I I like to dream,1
sp_20-12,But at the same time it's really hard for me to come to a compromise on these things because I I do have like a very deep understanding of my family's situation,1
sp_20-12,And well if it if it were something that was withing our limits definitely she would not she would not reject it the idea,1
sp_20-12,So they so generally they apply pressure only because it's realistic to do so,1
sp_20-12,I can't just do what I want,1
sp_20-12,So we don't have unlimited resources,1
sp_20-12,Mainly my parents they are generally not that worried about my decisions,1
sp_20-11,As well as how I'm going to get over there and what I'm going to do once I am there sort of thing,1
sp_20-11,And actually it's causing my family quite a bit of stress and me quite a bit of stress because I have to account for both our family like financial situation,1
sp_20-11,But at the same time is something that I really want to do,1
sp_20-11,So finding another opportunity to do something like that is something that is difficult,1
sp_20-11,And it wasn't cheap,1
sp_20-11,Especially since I already took one to go on a summer exchange to Stanford,1
sp_20-11,But at the same time those opportunities are really hard to come by,1
sp_20-11,I really want to have an opportunity to get out of Hong Kong,1
sp_20-11,But at the same time so the my main concern right now is actually I don't really plan on staying in Hong Kong forever,1
sp_20-11,At the moment I am not too concerned about too many things,1
sp_20-10,So it's like some sort of cultural boundary that I I couldn't seem to cross,1
sp_20-10,However one one regret is for some reason I can't really find anything to talk about with local people,1
sp_20-10,And it was kind of difficult to penetrate into their friend groups,1
sp_20-09,But eventually I gave up on the hardware aspects because I found that I wasn't really talented in that aspect,1
sp_20-06,It's the like I get the concept but at the same time it's so unfamiliar to be able to pull distributions out of out of a distribution,1
sp_20-06,So those concepts are really difficult to grasp especially the Dirichlet distribution,1
sp_20-06,Mainly because there is a lot of difficult mathematics regarding inference that I hadn't thought of and hadn't been exposed to,1
sp_20-06,Bayesian networks is by far my hardest class,1
sp_20-06,Now that I think of it I can't quite remember what the other oh and bayesian networks,1
sp_20-06,So I wanted to to just like overload on that to stop myself from doing that,1
sp_20-04,It's pretty hard to mess up that,1
sp_20-04,So if I want something sort of to release my stress I would usually color books,1
sp_20-04,Sometimes if I don't want to do drawing that was too stressful because sometimes you know if you if you draw scenery you can mess up,1
sp_20-03,Even though I also don't quite feel like I belong here,1
sp_20-03,And overall I didn't have that great of an experience,1
sp_20-03,Too many people that were a little a little rude,1
sp_20-03,Anything else is the I I don't really speak French,1
sp_20-02,But I didn't really pay much attention to the to the Stanford part,1
sp_19-11,And don't know how things will go later on,1
sp_19-11,So a bit nervous about that,1
sp_19-11,So I'm not sure how it would be like to be outside and doing something else,1
sp_19-11,Because this is the only thing that I have been doing for more than twenty years now,1
sp_19-11,And it's also mixed feeling to be graduating and finishing school,1
sp_19-11,So currently I'm feeling anxious about how to spend my break after graduation,1
sp_19-09,And I thought like I could learn a lot about different industries not like not particularly one that the area is more inclined towards,1
sp_19-08,So it's a bit difficult to manage like when to study and when to do the projects,1
sp_19-08,And deadlines about deadlines I have a couple of projects that are due during my exam period,1
sp_19-08,It's just like until you feel the rush you don't feel like studying,1
sp_19-08,And it's it's exam period is always a bit stressed because you don't know like what to study for and how to study,1
sp_19-08,So I just have a bit of exams which are going to start,1
sp_19-07,So that's a bit uncertain,1
sp_19-05,So I think I'm very picky when it comes to food,1
sp_19-04,Even harder than studying like you have to practice the skills it takes to the technique that it requires to play the guitar and then you have to learn the theory behind it,1
sp_19-03,But I mean it's better than like other places so I wouldn't mind staying there,1
sp_19-03,In Delhi you face that a lot so it's a bit difficult to live there,1
sp_19-03,And also because there is no power outtage,1
sp_25-12,So yeah I don't think there is any pressure from anybody at the moment now,0
sp_25-12,But they all always be there,0
sp_25-12,I made new friends all the time,0
sp_25-12,So no there is no pressure from my parent from my friends,0
sp_25-12,So there is they always trust me doing the right thing,0
sp_25-12,So first of all I am I am 22 and I am a guy so they trust me,0
sp_25-12,So I I wouldn't say there is any pressure from them,0
sp_25-12,They always let me life free or do whatever I want to,0
sp_25-12,So I left Romania when 4 years ago when I first when I first went to UK,0
sp_25-10,But mostly internationals at the moment,0
sp_25-10,So I think I can get some some a bit of local taste from from them,0
sp_25-10,I am I have these groups in another classes and we spent time together,0
sp_25-10,We also have a few in international especially local student especially in our courses,0
sp_25-10,But I am happy with with my international friends and we explored Hong Kong together,0
sp_25-10,And then in the middle of the semester and towards the end everyone is busy it's really hard to get in touch with them,0
sp_25-10,Reason is because  I don't think I had enough  I spent enough time with local students in the beginning,0
sp_25-10,So here I like I have I most interact with international students,0
sp_25-09,And then joining groups and then traveling together or doing stuff together,0
sp_25-09,So it was a good way of making friends rapidly,0
sp_25-09,Or I was in the beginning of the semester,0
sp_25-09,Yeah apart from that I can I am also involved in these exchange activities,0
sp_25-09,Reason because the reason is because I do sport when I was young so I can integrate in groups easily,0
sp_25-09, I feel like I can accommodate easily within this group here,0
sp_25-09,I think it was number 8 when I applied last year in Computer Science,0
sp_25-09,So I think this is the major reason why I came here and also being high ranked in though,0
sp_25-09,If you have like opening space here nearby on the islands,0
sp_25-09,I chose Hong Kong because it is more  it is higher rank in top universities and also because it is exotic,0
sp_25-09,Second of all I have to chose to choose between Hong Kong or Sydney in Australia,0
sp_25-09,So I came to Hong Kong because  so first of all it was on the list of universities I can go to in exchange from Southampton,0
sp_25-08,I am not scared with them,0
sp_25-08,And I am pretty confident I would do fine,0
sp_25-08,I think I would do fine in this exams,0
sp_25-08,So it would be interesting to see how I can accommodate and deal with this and I don't think it's very hard,0
sp_25-08,One of them is open notes which I found I find quite interesting because I haven't had a open note exam before,0
sp_25-08,They are both be on Friday,0
sp_25-07,But that was more on frontend development which is not my favorite thing to do,0
sp_25-07,Apart from that internship I also worked for Amazon 2 years ago,0
sp_25-07,I plan on being there for few years at least,0
sp_25-07,So I will go back for fulltime job,0
sp_25-07,But I enjoyed a lot,0
sp_25-07,And the reason is because I I did internship there last summer  and I enjoyed what I did there,0
sp_25-07,I will work for Bloomberg  in London from August 2017,0
sp_25-07,So after I graduate I have an offer already and I accepted the offer,0
sp_25-06,So even thought at surface you are dealing with words and like lexicons you and grammars that a lot of math behind the scenes,0
sp_25-06,The reason is because it goes the most indepth and you have to do a lot of maths,0
sp_25-06,I think the hardest one is Natural Language Processing,0
sp_25-06,The computer science ones are NLP search engines and  the one to the one that you are doing  Building Interactive Intelligent System,0
sp_25-06,3 of them are computer science related and 1 of them is entrepreneurship,0
sp_25-06,So here at UST I am taking 4 courses,0
sp_25-05,Yeah,0
sp_25-05,I will learn how to cook them in the future most probably,0
sp_25-05,And the fact that you cannot find them anywhere else than in South East Asia,0
sp_25-05,I like the spiciness from these dishes,0
sp_25-05,I think is Pad thai and Tom Yum,0
sp_25-05,So my favorite dish is Thai,0
sp_25-05,I cannot cook Asian food yet,0
sp_25-05,Sometimes I cook beef steak,0
sp_25-05,I can cook I can cook but simple stuff like chicken with rice with vegetable  broccoli carrots tomatoes,0
sp_25-05,I think it's the best cuisine the Thai the Thai one,0
sp_25-05,So my my favorite food is a Thai food,0
sp_25-04,So traveling sport and meeting new people,0
sp_25-04,Yeah,0
sp_25-04,When I say new food I mean crazy food I like crazy food such as  snake in Hong Kong I had Tarantulas in Cambodia Cambodia or like insects,0
sp_25-04,Apart of sport I love to travel to try new food and to meet new people,0
sp_25-04,So combining both of them is awesome,0
sp_25-04,Soccer because it involved physical activities chess because you have to use your brain,0
sp_25-04,So yeah,0
sp_25-04,I think I was 7,0
sp_25-04,Why because I use to do this when from when I was a a child,0
sp_25-04,I play soccer and chess,0
sp_25-04,In my free time I like to play sports,0
sp_25-03,Yeah,0
sp_25-03,So I think Hong Kong is is is in is better than my home country but I missed home so,0
sp_25-03,Yeah,0
sp_25-03,People food places international airport is accessible to all these countries nearby,0
sp_25-03,I only I only have to say good things about Hong Kong  to be honest,0
sp_25-03,Hong Kong I like Hong Kong I think I could live here for a number of years let say 3 or 4 years  full time,0
sp_25-03,And then we also have music festivals each year which are pretty good as well,0
sp_25-03,And  what I like about of my hometown is that the people there are most of them students and they come there all from around the country,0
sp_25-03, And there is if you want heard about Transylvania vampires,0
sp_25-03,Okay so my hometown is Cluj in Romania is in Transylvania,0
sp_25-02,It was cool because I was able to to find out more about Thailand from them,0
sp_25-02,And then we drive scooter,0
sp_25-02,So I lived with them for 3 days and she cooked for us in the morning,0
sp_25-02,And then they invite me invited to live with them at their house,0
sp_25-02,And they were Thai local people and we made friends,0
sp_25-02,A girl and a boy,0
sp_25-02,One specific thing which that I went to this island and then I met a couple on a ferry,0
sp_25-02,I was travelling by myself solo and then I was living in a hostel so I was able to become more sociable and meet new new people,0
sp_25-02,What I like about this was I made a lot of friends,0
sp_25-02,Okay so recently I have been to  Thailand in my spring break,0
sp_25-01,So I quite like it,0
sp_25-01,So I quite like it because I kind of  I was able to relate to his actions sometimes and the actor is pretty cool was Russell Crowe,0
sp_25-01, And I like it that because  it was about a smart guy a mathematician and it's about how he won the noble prize and how we was he is a schizophrenic and it was basically about his life like from his life,0
sp_25-01,I watched it yesterday actually,0
sp_25-01,Yeah so recently I watched a Beautiful Mind,0
sp_24-12,All my family performed really well academically so I kind of feel like I should do well as well,0
sp_24-10,Whereas back home I had a bigger group of people I would constantly meet,0
sp_24-10,I know a lot of people but I only have a really small group of people I actually like meet constantly,0
sp_24-10,And I don't really have that here,0
sp_24-10,And on weekends we would meet and cook something,0
sp_24-10,Back home I had my group of people like we were four five girls who always like ate together,0
sp_24-10,I have like a big community of people I can talk to or do something if I want to,0
sp_24-10,But yeah I think I get along quite well,0
sp_24-10,My most of my friends here are actually international students not even exchange students because I think we have like a similar rythms,0
sp_24-10,We just kind of sometimes go eat food together,0
sp_24-10,I met a few people but they don't live on campus,0
sp_24-09,So basically I wanted to come here because Hong Kong seemed like an interesting city and the view was nice and it's a decent school,0
sp_24-09,And for me that next school was UST,0
sp_24-09,So if there are people who have a better GPA than you and there's five places in like I don't know Carnegie Mellon then if those five people are better than you then you just go to your next school,0
sp_24-09,So what happens when you want to go on exchange is you give a list of the schools you want to go to,0
sp_24-09,And the reason I came to Hong Kong was actually because I got rejected from another school or not really rejected,0
sp_24-09,Like you start staying later in the LC and everything,0
sp_24-09,And I think that also influences the way of studying,0
sp_24-09,And here people are like oh I need to get this much and I need to be above average,0
sp_24-09,And people care a lot about their grades,0
sp_24-09,So I think I adapted a bit too much to the life here because I feel like people here are quite stressed and anxious,0
sp_24-08,And then once I'm done with that I can go on to the next thing,0
sp_24-08,And so I can study for one thing and not worry about the other,0
sp_24-08,And I think the work load is pretty okay because I'm really lucky to have everything really spaced out,0
sp_24-08,I have to do this and that,0
sp_24-08,I'm just kind of like okay today I'm allowed to do nothing and then it starts tomorrow,0
sp_24-06,So I kind of relaxed,0
sp_24-05,And not too much sugar and not too much salt where I think the Korean palette is a lot of sugar and a lot of salt and very strong and penetrating,0
sp_24-05,And I like my things to be a bit more plain,0
sp_24-05,And every time I'm with my friend and we cook together there is like a disagreement about like how much of this how much of that we need to use,0
sp_24-05,And I think the Korean food I make is very different from like Korean food that Koreans would make,0
sp_24-05,And I know how to cook some food but not most of it,0
sp_24-05,I eat a lot of Korean food in my free time actually,0
sp_24-05,So in general I like spicy food,0
sp_24-04,So I think running kind of replacing this stress relieve,0
sp_24-04,Like it used to be my thing where I could like get rid of stress by cutting up some carrots and chopping stuff and then like frying meat,0
sp_24-04,And so yeah usually back home I used to cook,0
sp_24-04,And I don't know since I started doing it for my health then suddenly I started enjoying it,0
sp_24-04,And I feel like if I run and I do work out it's easier to sleep,0
sp_24-04,So recently I picked up running because it really like frees up your mind,0
sp_24-03,So I prefer like Lausanne over Hong Kong,0
sp_24-03,You have to wait until you get like a seat,0
sp_24-03,Even if you go to like a chain like Starbucks there is no space,0
sp_24-03,If you leave UST there are so many people,0
sp_24-03,And I really miss this here,0
sp_24-03,And I just the thing I like most about there is like the markets and being able to just walk around,0
sp_24-03,And it's a lot smaller than Zurich,0
sp_24-03,And it's also the place where I went to university,0
sp_24-03,But the place I was born in is Lausanne,0
sp_24-03,So my hometown is Zurich which is where I spent most of my formative years,0
sp_24-02,And because I was with locals I got to see like all the local important things in a very short timeframe because I was only there for two days,0
sp_24-02,It's really spicy and has a lot of flavor,0
sp_24-02,I liked the food a lot better there than I like it in Hong Kong,0
sp_24-02,And yeah I I really liked the food,0
sp_24-02,And I went there to meet a friend,0
sp_24-02,So during the spring break I went to Changsha which is a city in China,0
sp_24-01,I'm just kind of like doing that because it's some kind of treat after studying,0
sp_24-01,And then I think it's a good series,0
sp_24-01,Because usually I would just binge watch an entire series when I'm really into it,0
sp_24-01,But it's it's not in a way that I'm like really commited to it,0
sp_24-01,And I think it's it's quite interesting,0
sp_24-01,But I discovered this TV show and I've been like watching it every evening one series,0
sp_24-01,I didn't have time to really watch any movies or good series because I've been busy studying,0
sp_23-12,That's the good part of living abroad there is no parent pressure no one they can't know what you are doing anyway so they can't pressure me,0
